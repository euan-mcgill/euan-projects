Ed Gamble 00:13 Welcome to the Off Menu podcast -- pouring the ice cold milk of chat on to the puffed rice of humour and listening to the pop.
James Acaster 00:22 Oh, I love it!
Ed Gamble 00:23 Yeah, we're happy with that?
James Acaster 00:25 How've you never done that before?
Ed Gamble 00:26 I dunno man.
James Acaster 00:27 We've never talked about snap, crackle and pop, really.
Ed Gamble 00:30 I was thinking of going with, like, turning the milk fun-flavoured or something. But it didn't quite work.
James Acaster 00:36 No, no, but y'know, keep that in the back pocket for another episode -- there'll be plenty more.
Ed Gamble 00:39 Oh yeah.
James Acaster 00:40 And this week's guest is music-related so listening for the pop. Actually, that's quite clever.
Ed Gamble 00:45 Very, very good indeed.
James Acaster 00:47 Quite clever.
Ed Gamble 00:48 James, before we reveal our special guest, perhaps you should tell the listener what the bloomin' 'ell we're doing here.

James Acaster 00:54 This is the Off Menu podcast. Me and Ed own the Dream Restaurant. Ed is the proprietor and I am a Genie, and we invite a guest every single week to tell us their favourite ever: Starter, Main Course, Dessert, Side Dish, and Drink. Not in that order. And this week, our guest is...
Both 01:09 Julie Adenuga!
Ed Gamble 01:12 Julie Adenuga: a wonderful broadcaster, DJ, radio host, presenter -- all of those things! She hosts a brilliant radio show on Apple Beats 1.
James Acaster 01:23 We've both done it!
Ed Gamble 01:24 We've both been on it. Very much enjoyed it.
James Acaster 01:26 A pleasure.
Ed Gamble 01:27 And Julie is also the host of the brand new Catfish UK, which is on Wednesdays at 9pm on MTV.
James Acaster 01:35 Catfish, baby!
Ed Gamble 01:36 I, myself, have never been catfished -- apart from the Great Benito.
James Acaster 01:42 Yeah, the Great Benito catfished you. You've been catfished by the Great Benito! And he always insists, "Ohh guys, make sure you mention the Secret Ingredient. Make sure you say what the Secret Ingredient is, that if a guest mentions it they get kicked out the Dream Restaurant!" and we say, "Okay Benito, this week's secret ingredient is..."
Ed Gamble 02:00 Tongue!
James Acaster 02:00 Tongue?

Tongue?! Tongue. We better hope that Julie Adenuga does not have tongue on her menu.
James Acaster 02:06 How has it been this long and we haven't said tongue as the Secret Ingredient? It's just universally acknowledged as disgusting.
Ed Gamble 02:15 Okay. Well, it's been so long, James, because obviously guess what?
James Acaster 02:18 You like it.
Ed Gamble 02:19 I like tongue.
James Acaster 02:20 What? What are you a cat?
Ed Gamble 02:22 No, I'm not a cat.
James Acaster 02:23 ISABELLA DOS SANTOS!
Ed Gamble 02:27 Pardon?
James Acaster 02:28 Isabella dos Santos.
Ed Gamble 02:29 What, what's that?
James Acaster 02:31 She suggested the Secret Ingredient.
Ed Gamble 02:33 Right, okay. Sorry, I got mixed up. I thought that was a joke that I didn't understand.
James Acaster 02:36 She suggested tongue.
Ed Gamble 02:37 Right, and that's how you're gonna say her name?

Ed Gamble 02:46 Thank you very much for suggesting tongue, ISABELLA DOS SANTOS!
James Acaster 02:53 It's cool, isn't it? It's fun to say it like that.
Ed Gamble 02:55 It's really cool, yeah. Don't forget that if you want to suggest the Secret Ingredient, get in contact on our Twitter.
James Acaster 03:02 Yes.
Ed Gamble 03:03 @OffMenuOfficial on the tweets, and we will probably announce your name in a fun way.
James Acaster 03:08 Yeah, I love announcing people's names in a fun way. But you know whose name I'm not gonna announce in a fun way? Julie Adenuga. Actually that was quite fun.
Ed Gamble 03:17 That was quite fun. Adenuga is word that's very difficult to say not in a fun way.
James Acaster 03:22 Yeah, I like to say Adenuga.

James Acaster 03:50 Welcome Julie Adenuga to the Dream Restaurant, we've been expecting you for some time.
Julie Adenuga 04:01 It took me ages to get a reservation. I'm so happy that I'm here.
James Acaster 04:04 I'm sorry, I did two explosions and then I slipped off of my sofa.
Julie Adenuga 04:08 How small is your sofa?
James Acaster 04:10 It's not that small. I'll tell you what it is: I'm slouching and I didn't realise my arms were holding me up on the armrests. And so when I did the explosion, I put my arms out in front of me and my body went: "oop, you're slipping down now."
Julie Adenuga 04:23 I like restaurants with sofas in them, to be fair. They feel a lot more inviting than just stiff chairs.
James Acaster 04:29 Yeah, that's true.

Ed Gamble 04:30 Yeah, that's true.
James Acaster 04:31 What would be your ideal thing to sit on while you're having a meal?
Julie Adenuga 04:35 I was gonna say a face but that's not the vibe here...
Julie Adenuga 04:36 It just felt like the right thing to say, but no -- I would not like to sit in a face at a restaurant. I just like to sit on comfy­ I don't want armrests in the restaurant, on the sofa. I think armrests is a bit too... you know what I mean? You need to be able to relax. But just something comfy. A nice comfy... I can't pronounce the name of the shop, but it's where I got my sofa from. It's M­triple O­I.
James Acaster 04:41 Look, the vibe in this podcast is whatever you want it to be.

I'm gonna congratulate you on things that probably feel really old to you but Ed, I loved you on Taskmaster.
Julie Adenuga 05:33 Loved it, loved it, loved it. James, I love Repertoire. I've only actually seen two of the four, because there's a lockdown and there's so many things to do, do you know what I mean? So...
Ed Gamble 05:33 Thank you very much.
James Acaster 05:37 I've been on Taskmaster too, since I last saw you... Some series are better than others.
Julie Adenuga 05:50 Okay. Relax, relax. Don't talk like that.
James Acaster 05:52 I wasn't in a vintage one.
Julie Adenuga 05:54 Relax. What's the other thing? Oh, Hypothetical. I love Hypothetical.
Ed Gamble 05:58 There you go.
Julie Adenuga 05:58 Love it, congratulations. I'll tuck into your Taskmaster soon.
James Acaster 06:02 I'm a bit happy.
Ed Gamble 06:03 Yeah?
Julie Adenuga 06:03 Wow. Wow. Give someone props, they're still complaining?
James Acaster 06:07 Yeah.
Ed Gamble 06:07 I know what you mean about Repertoire. There's such a lot of stuff to watch. It just tends to slip down the list, doesn't it? Four episodes.

James Acaster 06:18 Exactly.
Julie Adenuga 06:19 When it got to that can I swear?
James Acaster 06:20 Yeah.
Julie Adenuga 06:21 On a scale of zero to cunt, how much can I swear?
Ed Gamble 06:24 Yeah. Well, Julie, you didn't check at the beginning about sitting on someone's face, but now you've come to swearing and you're like, "Oh, I better check to..." [inaudible]
Julie Adenuga 06:32 But yeah, I got to the weird fucking orange with the fucking candles and the sweets in it. And I said: "I need to take a break from this"
James Acaster 06:41 Aw, man.
Julie Adenuga 06:41 This has gone to another place. I don't know if I can just jump straight into another episode.
Ed Gamble 06:45 Yeah, you just need to go and do something normal sometimes, right?
Julie Adenuga 06:48 And I had research to do into what on earth that was, but I absolutely loved it. Honestly. It was amazing. Congratulations, James.
James Acaster 06:54 Yeah, well, when I love stuff I usually knock it on the head.

Yeah.
Julie Adenuga 07:06 You've gotta balance it out with just regular lockdown shit. And then jump back into the joy.
James Acaster 07:11 Yeah, you watch season 9 of Taskmaster.
Julie Adenuga 07:15 You know what it was, I found out that Taskmaster is on UK Play TV. I refuse to have normal television in my house, so I've been discovering new apps so you can watch regular television. And then when I saw Taskmaster was on there I said, "Oh, I need to go see Ed." And so, you know, that's what I did. James, don't cry man. Fucking hell!
James Acaster 07:32 Have you watched all of Ed's series? Did you get to the end?
Julie Adenuga 07:34 No, no. I didn't get to the end. Absolutely not.

Catfish UK. If you don't know what catfishing is, it's a verb. It's a verb, right? It is a verb.
James Acaster 08:20 Yeah. I mean, it's also a food. So people might be thinking, "Oh, Julie's here promoting on a food podcast promoting her food show, all about catfish."
Julie Adenuga 08:28 I'm not. I'm promoting a show about people who changed their identities and lie for years and years and years. And for a lot of time, we thought it was only happening in America, but apparently even if you live 30 minutes away from someone, you can still catfish them for at least three years.
James Acaster 08:44 Wow.
Julie Adenuga 08:45 So yeah. So it's me and my good friend, Oobah Butler, and we are traveling around the UK, hearing these insane and incredible stories about people who have been having relationships with someone that they haven't seen. And it's our job to find out if the person they're talking to is in fact real, or if they are a catfish and it gets crazy is what I will say.
Ed Gamble 09:06 So sometimes they're real?
Julie Adenuga 09:07 Sometimes they are real. Yes, absolutely.
Ed Gamble 09:10 And when that happens, were you disappointed?
Julie Adenuga 09:12 Ah, yes, absolutely.
Ed Gamble 09:15 Are there, Julie, acceptable lies to tell online?
Julie Adenuga 09:18 I think if you change your hairline, it's okay.
Ed Gamble 09:22 Thank you for noticing.
Julie Adenuga 09:24 I think if you just edit your hairline a bit, just so it comes a bit more forward, that's not the end of the world. That's an acceptable lie, I think. Also, not disclosing how many children you have, I think is okay

at the start, do you know what I mean? Two years in, we should know that someone's had a birthday twice. But I think at the start, I don't need to say in my bio, you know what I mean? Mother of four, etc. I think that's okay.
James Acaster 09:48 But the headline thing, at what point is it not okay to lie about the headline? How much are you allowed to lie about the hairline?
Julie Adenuga 09:57 I think you can do up to one and a half centimetres. Anything more than that, and you're just in lying territory.
James Acaster 10:03 You're a different person.
Julie Adenuga 10:04 Yeah, exactly.
James Acaster 10:05 Yeah. Are you going to be lying today on our podcast when we ask about your favourite foods?
Julie Adenuga 10:09 No, I have put my hands up and I said, there was so many things I've thought about before recording with you guys. And I thought, "No, I'm actually going to tell the truth." Which in some parts is going to make me sound stupid and I'm okay with that. But just be nice, guys, okay?
James Acaster 10:22 We're nice guys.
Ed Gamble 10:23 No, we can't promise that, James.
James Acaster 10:26 We've been nice to every guest who's been on this podcast.
Julie Adenuga 10:28 Okay, yeah. Just be nice. But there's certain things, y'know, I grew up in a Nigerian home, so dinner is very different where I come from.

James Acaster 10:49 Okay.
Julie Adenuga 10:49 But right now guys, you're in a Nigerian restaurant, so­
James Acaster 10:51 Oh, lovely.
Julie Adenuga 10:52 Just get on board, okay?
Ed Gamble 10:53 Fully.
James Acaster 10:53 Yeah!
James Acaster 10:56 Still or sparkling water, Julie?
Julie Adenuga 10:58 Stupid question, still. Next question.
James Acaster 11:01 Poppadoms or bread?
Julie Adenuga 11:06 Why did you lot even add this in? What was the point of this bit? I fucking hate it. Who wants sparkling water? Sparkling water is an example of how human beings have ruined the earth, yeah? Because there's so many things that just naturally exist. And for some reason we were just like, "No, we're going to do extra things to super natural, normal shit." And someone said, "Let's make water bubbly." It's the dumbest thing I've ever heard of in my life. It should be illegal. Next question.
Ed Gamble 11:37 So, is the whole of your menu and everything you eat­ Do you only eat things that naturally occur without any man-made interference?
Julie Adenuga 11:45 That's a brilliant question, Ed. The answer is no. No, but I think water is the purest thing that exists on the planet. Why would you change it? What person was so bored that they thought, "I'm going to

change water." It's like, the fucking basis of all things. And they said, "I don't like it." It's arrogant, actually if you ask me. It's arrogant. Fuck sparkling water.
James Acaster 12:11 Do you like squash? Would you ever put some cordial in some water?
Julie Adenuga 12:15 No, I think that's stupid as well, I'll be honest. Because­
Ed Gamble 12:19 I thought you had her there. I was nodding. I was like, "Yeah, you get her James. Oh no, she's got that. That's fine."
Julie Adenuga 12:27 Yeah, no, I'm not into it. I don't even like the word. What is it? Cord... Say it.
James Acaster 12:30 Cordial.
Julie Adenuga 12:31 Cordial?
James Acaster 12:32 Yeah.
Julie Adenuga 12:32 Which is not the word cordial?
James Acaster 12:34 No.
Julie Adenuga 12:34 Which is when you're nice to someone.
James Acaster 12:36 Yeah.
Julie Adenuga 12:37 Stupid. Again, just taking a word that was fine. And then making it something else that needs to be diluted. It's just all dumb.
James Acaster 12:43 Oh, hold on so you think they took the word 'cordial' and they changed it to make the word 'cordial'?

Ed Gamble 12:56 You thought Mr. Robinson was like, "I've got my big pot of lye water that I've invented and I'll just start taking things from language. Cordial, hmm. I'll take that."
Julie Adenuga 13:05 Ed, have you noticed that over time you speak more and more like James?
Ed Gamble 13:09 Yeah, it tends to sort of morph into each other.
Julie Adenuga 13:12 So what is, how..? What does that feel like?
Ed Gamble 13:15 We hang out all the time.
Julie Adenuga 13:16 That's so weird.
Ed Gamble 13:17 Yeah.
Julie Adenuga 13:17 James, what have you taken from Ed?
James Acaster 13:20 I mean, I think I also have picked up some of the ways that Ed talks. I think we encourage each other on that front. And we recommend albums to each other. We listen to some of the same music.
Julie Adenuga 13:31 No, that's boring. I wanted actual behavioural overlaps. Not just like, "Oh, we're friends and we do nice friend things."
James Acaster 13:39 Yeah. I have diabetes. Well, I'm convinced I have it.
Julie Adenuga 13:45 Oh, you're convinced?

James Acaster 13:58 No, I have done that. And what the listeners probably don't know is that we're currently recording this on, well, I don't know if it's called Easter Tuesday?
Ed Gamble 14:06 No, it's not.
James Acaster 14:06 But it's the Tuesday after the Easter weekend so obviously, I'm feeling a little bit tense after the weekend I just had.
Julie Adenuga 14:12 When's your doctor's appointment?
James Acaster 14:14 Oh, I'm just gonna go to a walk-in clinic, I think.
Julie Adenuga 14:19 That is brilliant. Wow.
Ed Gamble 14:21 It's only the Acaster family that call it Easter Tuesday, because their Easter's run three weeks after everyone else.

Ed Gamble 14:35 Easter Sunday 2: The Eastering.

Julie Adenuga 14:56 You're lying.
Ed Gamble 14:57 I'm not lying. It comes out of a mountain, slightly sparkling.

James Acaster 15:22 Yeah.
Julie Adenuga 15:24 I'm taking that.
Ed Gamble 15:25 Take it for series two?
James Acaster 15:26 I'm taking that.
Ed Gamble 15:27 If you run out of people to do on series two, do water.
Julie Adenuga 15:32 I'm going to pitch that to the team as soon as I see them. Thanks, Ed.
Ed Gamble 15:35 Just you running up to the front door, coming open, and it's just a big bottle of fizzy water.
Julie Adenuga 15:42 I'm going to ask if you two can be the guest hosts of that episode, that'd be great. But you have to both wear matching tops like you are today.
Ed Gamble 15:48 Yes. Both got pink t-shirts on today.
James Acaster 15:50 Both got pink t-shirts on, Julie immediately found it hysterical.
Julie Adenuga 15:53 Because it's just so random. I know that you both noticed. Did you speak about it?

When you noticed? When you saw each other, did you say, "Ah, we're matching again."
James Acaster 16:03 No, we didn't weirdly.
Ed Gamble 16:04 Well James wears that t-shirt a lot. And I think I wear this t-shirt a lot so...
James Acaster 16:07 So you want still water?
Julie Adenuga 16:09 Yes, please.
James Acaster 16:10 I'm guessing you want nothing in it. No unnatural things added to it that aren't normally in water. You wouldn't get lemon floating around in water, in the wild. So no lemon in it, no ice cubes because they wouldn't be floating around in it in the wild.
Julie Adenuga 16:25 A friend of mine taught me something, which he shouldn't have had to teach me at all actually. When you get ice cubes in bottled water, it's weird because obviously ice cubes aren't from bottled water. So it's just frozen tap water in your fresh bottled water. Then it melts and then you get shit. So I don't do ice and water anymore. I try to go room temperature, no lemon. Because that's weird as well. You just get bits of lemon floating around in your mouth. It's just, God, I just hate anything that isn't pure water.
Ed Gamble 16:57 Again, I thought James had you. I thought he's got her in a corner here.
James Acaster 17:00 Yeah.
Ed Gamble 17:00 She's obviously going to want ice. She's going to want lemon, but you stopped drinking ice because it was, to quote, unnatural.
Julie Adenuga 17:09 Damn it, is that an actual direct quote? Did I really did say that?
Ed Gamble 17:14 I don't know. It's easy to make things up. Even if you're recording then we can just say you said something. People will probably believe it.

That's true.
Ed Gamble 17:19 When you go into a restaurant, you say I'd like "Still water, please. Bottled still water. Don't put anything in it and I want it room temperature." Yeah?
Julie Adenuga 17:27 You're making me sound so aggressive. But yes, that is essentially what happens when I go to restaurants.
James Acaster 17:28 I don't think we're making you sound so aggressive. Earlier on you shouted, "Fuck sparkling water." You shouted it!
Julie Adenuga 17:39 If it is cold, when they bring it though, I just leave it for a while for the room temperature to just happen naturally. You know what I mean? Clearly I'm into very natural things, guys. I think you're picking that up from this.
Ed Gamble 17:48 But you know cold is not unnatural?
Julie Adenuga 17:50 Yeah, but they put it in a fridge, Ed. And now my body has got to warm it up to room temperature, otherwise it's not going to be good is it? I've just got to wait a bit.
Ed Gamble 17:58 Well, I'm looking forward your main course of steak ripped directly from the cow.
James Acaster 18:02 You want nothing from the fridge, am I right? We could get rid of the fridge and the freezer and the oven and everything?
Julie Adenuga 18:09 No, no, no. I need those for other things.
Ed Gamble 18:11 All right, okay.

James Acaster 18:25 Oh sorry, sorry. Sorry Julie, we made you sound aggressive again there, sorry.
Julie Adenuga 18:30 Wait, what are Poppadoms again? They're like giant crisps yeah? Giant flavourless crisps.
James Acaster 18:35 Yeah, well not flavourless.
Ed Gamble 18:37 This is the first time I've ever heard anyone scream, "Fuck something." And then ask what it is.
Julie Adenuga 18:47 In my head I'm just like... Sorry. No unfuck Poppadoms. Unfuck them.
James Acaster 18:52 Okay.
Julie Adenuga 18:53 I'll go Poppadoms over bread. Definitely.
James Acaster 18:55 Wow. That's the biggest u-turn we've ever had on this podcast. Someone screaming, "Fuck Poppadoms the motherfuckers." And then going, "Actually unfuck them, I'll have them over bread."
Julie Adenuga 19:05 Unfuck them. I'll tell you why: I like to try and break them into quarters. Actual from 9pm to 12pm, actual quarters like a real one. And then I like to balance rice on top of it with a bit of a madras and then eat it like a pizza.
James Acaster 19:22 Lovely.
Ed Gamble 19:22 So, with your poppadoms, are we bringing you a full curry and rice?
Julie Adenuga 19:26 Yes.
Ed Gamble 19:26 So you can do that.

Yes please, I wouldn't mind.
James Acaster 19:30 Instead of the dips. We'll use the same pots that the dips would usually go in and we'll put curry and rice in them.
Julie Adenuga 19:37 I love this restaurant. I absolutely love it here. You guys are amazing waiters.
James Acaster 19:41 Thank you, that means a lot. This is the biggest turnaround we've ever had of someone screaming that they hate it, saying, "Fuck it," and then going, "Actually, I prefer it to the other option." Why were you shouting that in the first place?
Julie Adenuga 19:56 Because I hate carbs at the moment.
James Acaster 19:58 Okay.
Julie Adenuga 19:58 I hate carbs. They've become the bane of my existence whilst I've been locked in my home. And so my immediate gut reaction was, "That feels carby, get them away from me." And so that was my first response. But then when I calmed down and stopped being aggressive, I thought, "No, I like poppadoms, I should stop being so mean towards them," because outside of lockdown, when I can get a better carb balance, I'm gonna be on the poppadoms straight away.
Ed Gamble 20:24 So your initial thought was, "I hate carbs, I don't want them anywhere near my meal." And your second response was, "Bring me poppadoms and a bowl of rice that I can pile on top of them."
Julie Adenuga 20:35 I'm really not enjoying you translating my thoughts­
James Acaster 20:40 I thought you loved this restaurant and we were great waiters?
Julie Adenuga 20:42 ­into sensible sentences.
James Acaster 20:44 We were getting compliments earlier.

Yeah, but stop telling people what I'm actually saying. Just let them hear what­
James Acaster 20:50 I'll tell you what. In this anti-carb chat as well-
Ed Gamble 20:53 Yeah, why do you hate carbs at the moment?
James Acaster 20:54 ­bread is just standing by going, "I can't believe I'm getting away with this. Can't believe no one's coming after me."
Julie Adenuga 21:00 Yeah, no, breads, no, no, we've got to get rid of bread. It's nah, come on. We've got to stop now with the bread thing. We have to, it's carb hell. And it's the easiest food to make. Sometimes my toaster and I have back-to-back toast sessions­
James Acaster 21:17 Yeah, yeah.
Julie Adenuga 21:18 ­where I'm just toasting, buttering, eating, toasting, just constantly. So you can see that the carb thing is, I've had a carb overload, guys, over the last year.
Ed Gamble 21:29 So you don't hate carbs, you love them too much, right?
Julie Adenuga 21:32 Exactly. This is very triggering by the way. This is a restaurant of many emotions. But yeah, I've had way too many carbs and I need to relax is the truth. Okay? Before you translate it, Ed.
James Acaster 21:43 How many slots you got in your toaster?
Julie Adenuga 21:45 Oh, brilliant question. I've got four. I've got a question for you two now. Is it normal to toast bread in odds?
James Acaster 21:54 Oh...
Julie Adenuga 21:54 And do you do it?

James Acaster 21:55 I have done it actually. Yeah, it depends how big the slices are.
Julie Adenuga 21:59 Go on.
James Acaster 21:59 Well, if I've got a load of standard loaf slices, sometimes I don't want four, but two is too little, and so I will have three. A lot of the time, if it's smaller than the standard loaf, then I'll usually have four and just go all out. But if the slices look pretty big, I might go for three, rather than four.
Julie Adenuga 22:23 Have you got a four-slot toaster?
James Acaster 22:26 I've got a four-slot toaster.
Julie Adenuga 22:27 So you will put three slices of bread in the four-slot toaster, and there'll just be one slot that's heating nothing. Just-
James Acaster 22:34 That's heating nothing. Well, sometimes I just put my cheek to it and just feel the warmth.
Julie Adenuga 22:40 That is disgusting.
James Acaster 22:42 Well, you say that.
Ed Gamble 22:43 That is disgusting actually, James.
James Acaster 22:45 I wasn't expecting disgusting. Well, here's another reason why I do it. I've got three spreads that I like on my toast.
Ed Gamble 22:52 Now this is mad.

Butter on its own, Marmite and marmalade. And if I have three different slices, I do a butter slice, a Marmite slice, a marmalade slice, and I eat them in that order: a starter, main course and pudding.
Julie Adenuga 23:08 No. Okay, here comes the question. What is the difference between butter and marmalade?
James Acaster 23:12 Pardon me?
Ed Gamble 23:12 Between butter and marmalade?
Julie Adenuga 23:14 Yeah. What's marmalade? Wait, what am I thinking of?
James Acaster 23:16 What's the difference between butter and... You're thinking of margarine.
Julie Adenuga 23:19 Oh yeah, I'm thinking of margarine. Okay, cool. Marmalade is what?
James Acaster 23:22 Marmalade is like orange jam.
Julie Adenuga 23:25 Oh yes. Marmalade is delicious.
James Acaster 23:27 Yeah, just Googled it and now you're holding up the Google images of marmalade to us.
Julie Adenuga 23:30 Yeah, marmalade's delicious. Which one do you have? The one that everybody gets?
James Acaster 23:33 I've currently got Robertson's with shreds in it.

James Acaster 23:51 Why? It's a little mini meal: starter, main course, dessert.
Julie Adenuga 23:54 That's very strange.
James Acaster 23:55 Butter, Marmite, Marmalade.
Julie Adenuga 23:57 So you don't do jam on top of butter?
James Acaster 24:00 Nope, 'cause it's a little starter. It's just the toast with the butter on it. And then main course, something that really attacks the palette, Marmite. It's a really hefty main course. And then a lovely sweet dessert with the marmalade.
Julie Adenuga 24:14 With the shreds.
Ed Gamble 24:15 I'd go Marmite every slice.
Julie Adenuga 24:17 You're also going in the bin, because that's disgusting.
Ed Gamble 24:19 Thick butter, thicker Marmite than you could ever imagine.
Julie Adenuga 24:23 Wait, you go butter and then Marmite on top?!
Ed Gamble 24:26 Yes. Yes, Julie.
Julie Adenuga 24:27 Whoa, whoa. Honestly, you two are disgusting. I'm loving it though, but you're absolutely vile, both of you. Wait, Ed, do you do odd slices?

Off Menu ­ Ep 101: Julie Adenuga

Julie Adenuga 24:38 But have you ever done one slice of toast?
Ed Gamble 24:40 No, one slice is never enough, is it? So I'd always go two slices. And I'll rarely, if I want more toast, I'll rarely be able to bring myself to do more, because it's going through that action again, I'd be like, "Oh God, I can't do that." And plus I've put so much on the first two slices, I've gone absolutely mad. Sometimes Julie, and get a load of this, I'll put Marmite in a bacon sandwich. How'd you feel about that?
Julie Adenuga 25:01 Has the bacon sandwich got bacon in it?
James Acaster 25:03 What the fuck?
Ed Gamble 25:04 No Julie, no bacon in it. And no bread either.
Julie Adenuga 25:09 I need to ask!
Ed Gamble 25:10 I'm sat in my room just thinking about it.
James Acaster 25:12 Do you know what? We've asked some pretty dumb questions on this podcast, me and Ed are pretty guilty of it, but never before have we asked someone if a bacon sandwich has bacon in it?
Julie Adenuga 25:23 I was actually trying to help Ed out just now, because the fact that you put Marmite in a sandwich that has bacon in it makes you the most grim creature on the planet. So I was trying to help you out by saying, "I call it a bacon sandwich, but I don't actually put bacon." I was trying to be stupid to help you.
James Acaster 25:37 That's his get out, is that he can say to people, "I like putting Marmite in a bacon sandwich." And before they attack him he goes, "Hold the bacon."
Julie Adenuga 25:45 Exactly.
James Acaster 25:46 And then everyone's like, "Oh, he's having a Marmite sandwich."

Julie Adenuga 25:49 Exactly!
Ed Gamble 25:50 Thanks, Julie, actually. I thought you were being stupid but thanks, you're being so helpful.
James Acaster 25:54 But what you like to do, Julie, is you like to get the toast out, your four slices of toast. And while you're eating those slices, you've got another four slices of bread toasting in the toaster already so that you can just do it on rotation.
Julie Adenuga 26:06 Yeah.
James Acaster 26:07 That is disgusting.
Julie Adenuga 26:12 I did it from when I was young. Me and my little brother, actually all of my brothers, I think we did it. We just took the toaster up. Because I had an epiphany once where I realized that the toaster doesn't have to be in the kitchen. It's just an appliance. So we just took it upstairs to our bedroom and we just back to back toasted until the loaf was finished. It was a really great time.
James Acaster 26:14 You took the toaster up to your bedroom?
Julie Adenuga 26:31 Yes! There is no need for it to be in the kitchen.
Ed Gamble 26:34 That's blown my mind, actually.
James Acaster 26:35 It is blowing my mind.
Ed Gamble 26:36 Toaster in the Bedroom. That'd be a good title for your autobiography.

Julie Adenuga 27:29 Hey, don't do that. You can't bring up my past, it's not fair. I don't believe in them, I think they're stupid. If you're hungry, why are you giving me the beginning of the meal? Just give me the food that I would like to eat. I'm very much a "Hey, can I have the prawns and whatever the main is, and just bring them all as soon as they're ready, please, sir."
Ed Gamble 27:49 Right, so you are having a Starter, you're just having it all at the same time?
Julie Adenuga 27:51 No, but I'm having it as the meal. I'm not picking it because I want to eat it separately. I'm picking it because it goes well with all the food that I'd like to consume in this one sitting.
James Acaster 27:59 Starter's are like glorified side dishes really aren't there. They're not really a thing.
Ed Gamble 28:03 No, they're a completely different genre.
Julie Adenuga 28:04 They're so stupid. Ed, should we look up the definition of what the fucking hell the point is of a Starter in a meal?
James Acaster 28:09 Yeah. Make sure you word it like that when you Google it.
Ed Gamble 28:11 You think, if you Google, "what the hell is the point of a starter in a meal?" you're going to get something back that solves this, right?
Julie Adenuga 28:17 I'm actually going to do it, because what is the actual point?
Ed Gamble 28:20 Julie, your Google is not going to explain anything to you. The last thing you Googled was marmalade. It's not even going to let you log on. It's going to be like, there's no point in telling this lady anything.

Julie Adenuga 28:44 I Googled: "what the fucking hell is the point of a starter in a meal?"

Julie Adenuga 28:49 The first result is a Reddit result and it says, "I live with roommates."
James Acaster 28:53 Interesting.
Ed Gamble 28:54 "And one of them toasts in the bedroom. What do I do?"
Julie Adenuga 28:58 That's a fire hazard, isn't it? Definitely.
Ed Gamble 28:59 Yes.
Julie Adenuga 29:00 Yeah. Don't try toasting at home unless you are with a supervised adult is what we should say.
James Acaster 29:05 Yeah.
Julie Adenuga 29:06 I don't even know what to search to find the reason for a Starter.

Ed, what is the point? Tell us.
Ed Gamble 29:17 An extra little meal. A mini meal at the beginning, like we're talking about.
Julie Adenuga 29:22 A mini meal at the beginning?
Ed Gamble 29:23 Fires up the palate.
James Acaster 29:24 That's what he thinks it is. Isn't that sad?
Julie Adenuga 29:26 It doesn't make any sense. It's stupid.
James Acaster 29:28 No.
Ed Gamble 29:29 What doesn't make any sense? What if you want something from the Starter menu that doesn't necessarily go together with the Main? You get the Starter first, eat it, delicious, wait a little bit, and then have the Main. It's like you're getting two meals in one.
Julie Adenuga 29:40 So then I'll just have two Mains.
James Acaster 29:41 How do you feel about the part of that sentence Julie, where Ed said, "wait a minute"? Eat something, wait a minute, then get your actual meal. Does "wait a minute" feel good?
Julie Adenuga 29:53 No, it definitely doesn't. Here's how I think about it: I only go and eat when I'm hungry. So if I'm hungry, my body isn't going, "Oh, I'm excited about this little thing first." There aren't compartments of my stomach. The food is going to go down-
Ed Gamble 30:11 At what point Julie, did I accuse you of having compartments of your stomach?
Julie Adenuga 30:16 This is why, in my head, if there's a Starter, I'm assuming that it's going to go to a different part, there's like a bit of my body that needs a Starter and then my stomach needs the Mains. Well, actually, all of

the food just goes down the same tube into the same place. So whether it was a Starter, Main, whatever, it doesn't matter. It's just all food. So why are you giving it to me at a separate time?
Ed Gamble 30:36 Then why are we giving you any other sort of food? Why don't we just give you powder, because it all turns into shit in the end. That's what you're saying.
Julie Adenuga 30:42 No, I'm saying that when I want to eat, I want to eat now. So give me all the food that I'd like to consume.
Ed Gamble 30:48 Yeah, give you a Starter.
Julie Adenuga 30:49 No, because this is the other thing that annoys me, Ed. Yeah, aggressive Julie's back.
Ed Gamble 30:53 She never went anywhere.
Julie Adenuga 30:55 That's true. When I order my Starter and my Main, how do you know when I'm ready for my Main?
Ed Gamble 30:59 Well, after you've had your Starter.
Julie Adenuga 31:01 Right, so that means that I've got eat my Starter, then you've got to see that I've finished. Then you've got to come over, take the plate. Then you've got to go back into the kitchen. Then you've got to get the food and then bring me my...
Ed Gamble 31:11 It's the waiter.
Julie Adenuga 31:11 It's long.
Ed Gamble 31:12 This is what a waiter has to do.
Julie Adenuga 31:13 No, because if they're now serving someone else, I've got to wait for them to finish serving someone else to then say, "Oh, she's finished her Starter." And then if someone else at the table hasn't finished

James Acaster 31:32 No starters. Pass.
Ed Gamble 31:33 Yeah, but what I'm saying to you Julie is­
Ed Gamble 31:33 Yes okay, fine, pass on the Starter, but you can't then have what you would have had as a Starter with your Main Course, okay?
Julie Adenuga 31:33 Yes I can.
James Acaster 31:36 Pass.
Ed Gamble 31:42 No you can't. That's not how it works.
Julie Adenuga 31:43 I absolutely can.

Julie Adenuga 31:46 Yeah, you're in a Nigerian restaurant, there are no rules.
James Acaster 31:48 Yeah.
Julie Adenuga 31:48 Exactly.
Ed Gamble 31:49 Well, it's a Nigerian restaurant that's run by two white men and they don't understand what goes on.

Ed Gamble 32:04 All right. Maybe you have like a Starter that has sort of an Asian flavor to it. And then you have a Main Course that's like a Steak and Chips or something. You want to taste things from across the globe and put them into little compartments, like you have in your stomach.
Julie Adenuga 32:18 Yeah, but you can just eat all of them. If I had a Sunday Roast, and the Starter was, what's like a basic starter? Like prawns, tempura...
James Acaster 32:27 Calamari.
Julie Adenuga 32:28 Calamari, thank you. I would just eat all of those things together.
Ed Gamble 32:32 Yeah, but that's mad, isn't it?
Julie Adenuga 32:32 I would not at any point go, "I'm going to eat the calamari and then I'm just going to look out the window, and then I'm going to eat my roast." I'm just going to eat all the food, I'm hungry.
Ed Gamble 32:44 So in this situation, you've got roast dinner. So you've got potatoes, you've got gravy, you've got meat, you've got veg, you've got whatever. And you're just dumping calamari on top of that, you're getting gravy on your calamari?
Julie Adenuga 32:55 100%. Get it all in there. I'm hungry. Have you ever seen me hungry?
Ed Gamble 33:00 That's a good autobiography title as well.
Julie Adenuga 33:03 I've got so many things to take away from this. But when I'm hungry, I don't have time to think about the fact that gravy is going to be mixing with the calamari, I don't care. I just want to eat the food. I want to eat it now. Just please.
James Acaster 33:15 I get the feeling that what you would like in an ideal world is to be sitting in your bedroom, you're eating calamari and you've got the equivalent of a kind of toaster in front of you. So it's like when you were eating your toast and you've got the toast toasting, ready to go. But when you finished that bite of toast, it pops up again and you can start this next round. You want that, but with your Starters and your Main Course.

Julie Adenuga 33:36 Yeah, James understands me. James understands me.
Ed Gamble 33:38 So within food, you seem to really enjoy things as much as possible, back to back, quickly, get it all done. So James' specials must have really annoyed you for you to stop halfway through. To take a break for you is a big statement.
James Acaster 33:54 Oh yeah. That is bad, isn't it? That does sound like it's breaking the habit of a lifetime.
Julie Adenuga 34:02 James, you stood up for me, I'm going to stand up for you. Eating meals in a pandemic, it's very different to eating meals just regularly. So, same goes for James' comedy.
James Acaster 34:13 Yeah.
Julie Adenuga 34:14 Exactly. On a normal day, I'd sit down, I'd put aside the time and I'd bang all the way through Repertoire. But during a pandemic, I've got to save some for the other days that are going to be hell. Do you know what I mean?
James Acaster 34:23 Just to flag up to you, I wouldn't leave it too long if you are planning on watching the other two, because the final one has callbacks to the ones you've already seen and if you leave it too long, it's gonna make no sense.
Julie Adenuga 34:32 I'm going to forget what's happened.

Okay, I won't be aggressive.
James Acaster 34:56 I'm not criticising you. You didn't like sparkling water because it's not natural, but you are mixing your calamari with your Sunday Roast. And I'm not sure, is that the same thing as putting the bubbles in the water? Putting the calamari in the gravy with the Sunday Roast, is it similar?
Julie Adenuga 35:14 I'm going to say no, because I'm not dipping the calamari in the gravy and eating it. I'm just chewing and swallowing. It's elementary, guys. I pick up the calamari, I chew it, I swallow it. I pick up a bit of Yorkshire Pudding, chew it, swallow. It's all chew and swallow. You know what I mean? The bubbles are in the water, I don't get to separate them with sparkling water. But with this specific scenario, they are going down at separate times. Another name for a biography.

Julie Adenuga 36:11 Oh my gosh. Okay, so the main course is a Nigerian dish. So it's Ground Rice with Egusi Stew. And then I have it with a bit of Tomato Stew on top, and the protein in it is beef basically. And it's absolutely scrumptious. I love it with all my heart.
James Acaster 36:28 Talk us through these stews.
Julie Adenuga 36:29 So Ground Rice is, I wish I could find an equivalent to Ground Rice. So Ground Rice is literally, ground rice, but you hit it, it almost has the texture of Play-Doh. It's like a dough. So you hit it in water, it starts as a powder, hit it, hit it, hit it until it becomes like thick and nice. And then that's it, it's done. You can add sugar to it, which my dad used to do when I was younger, but it's bad for you. So then you have that by itself. And that's just like a white ball of dough. And then Egusi Stew is literally egusi seeds that you ground and you make it with spinach. You can add crayfish or stockfish, if you want to. And then you add the beef in as well that's cooked. And then the Tomato Stew, is literally just, it's Tomato Stew. It's just blended tomatoes with pepper and stuff in it. And my mom used to add, they don't actually come together, but my mom used to add a little bit on top of the Egusi Stew, which made it just really special. And then yeah, you pick up the ground rice, dip it in the stew, eat it with the meat and it's so filling and delicious. You don't need to eat for the whole day after you've had that meal.
James Acaster 37:34 That's why you don't want a Starter beforehand.
Julie Adenuga 37:36 That's also why you don't need a Starter when you're eating Ground Rice and Egusi Stew. Very good point, James.
Ed Gamble 37:41 I prefer that argument. We could have saved a lot of hassle there if you'd just said, "My Main's quite filling, so I'm not going to have a starter. I'd have been like, "Yeah, fine."
Julie Adenuga 37:48 That does sound like something that would make you happy, yes, but that's probably why I didn't say it.
Ed Gamble 37:52 And then I'd be looking forward to the Main Course. I'd be like, "What's this Main Course going to be if it's so filling that you can't have your calamari?"
Julie Adenuga 37:58 But now you hate me so much, you don't even care about my Main Course.
Ed Gamble 38:00 Yeah, bad luck.

James Acaster 38:01 Lot of hate in this menu. Who's making this stew for you? It's your dream one -- is it the one that your mum used to make?
Julie Adenuga 38:09 Absolutely, it has to be mum's one. Has to be mum's one. I've been to a few restaurants and had it, but it's just not the same, is it? Nothing's the same as mum's one. So yeah, mum's making it. I'd actually ask my dad to make the Ground Rice. Mum would make the Egusi Stew and the Tomato Stew and the Beef.
James Acaster 38:25 Is there anywhere where you have been, restaurant wise, where you would recommend to people to get good stews?
Julie Adenuga 38:31 I would say there's a place called 805, literally those numbers. 805 in Hendon, North London. Then you have a place called Enish in Brixton. And if you live in west and east, I don't care about your existence.
James Acaster 38:45 And if you live outside of London, bad luck.
Julie Adenuga 38:47 Yeah, if you live outside of London, then there probably aren't going to be any Nigerian restaurants anyway, to be fair if you're in the UK somewhere, but if you find one, well done, you found a unicorn.
James Acaster 38:47 Let us know!
Julie Adenuga 38:49 Let us know, yeah.
James Acaster 38:49 Any Nigerian restaurants outside of London, tweet the podcast, tweet Julie, also tweet pictures of marmalade at Julie.

James Acaster 39:08 You thought I was having butter, Marmite, and then margarine for dessert.
Ed Gamble 39:11 What you need to do now, listeners, is we're going to set Julie a quiz: so, either send her a picture of margarine, mayonnaise or marmalade and say, "which one is this?"
James Acaster 39:21 Yeah: "Which one is this?"
Ed Gamble 39:23 And she has to respond with the correct answer.
James Acaster 39:25 Don't send her a photo of all three and say: "name them all". Send her a photo of one of them: "which one's this?" without Googling it.
Ed Gamble 39:32 Yeah.
James Acaster 39:33 No, you just got it wrong again.
Julie Adenuga 39:33 Oh no. I'm going to get this wrong because marmalade and butter, they're the same isn't it? Am I going mad?
Julie Adenuga 39:44 What's the other one called?
James Acaster 39:45 Margarine. But margarine and butter aren't the same, margarine is like an alternative.
Julie Adenuga 39:50 Okay. So remember that thing 'I Can't Believe It's Not Butter?' -- that was actually the name of it -- that was margarine, right?
Ed Gamble 39:56 Yeah I think so. I think like a butter alternative, basically.
James Acaster 39:59 It wasn't butter.

Julie Adenuga 40:00 What's the actual difference between butter and margarine?
Ed Gamble 40:04 I think margarine is made with oil, isn't it? It's made with sunflower oil or something, as opposed to being made with dairy.
Julie Adenuga 40:10 Okay, fair enough.
Ed Gamble 40:11 As far as I know.
Julie Adenuga 40:12 Send me a picture of marmalade, margarine or mayonnaise. And I will correctly guess. For every one that I get wrong, I'll donate some money to charity.
James Acaster 40:21 Oh God. Okay, great.
Ed Gamble 40:23 That's awesome. You have just absolutely opened the flood gates. So how full is this Main making it though?
Julie Adenuga 40:30 So this is the kind of main that if you had it at 6pm, you probably wouldn't even need to eat breakfast the next day.
James Acaster 40:41 Wow.
James Acaster 40:41 Whoa. So is this why, as well, you want a bit of a break before your dessert?
Julie Adenuga 40:46 Yes. Exactly, this is why -- because you need time to let the food digest. Going back to your point, Ed, 'Mr. I hate you, Julie'. When you had your Main, if it's a good enough Main, you should be too full to eat something immediately after, especially something that has been designed to feel like a reward for eating your Main.
Julie Adenuga 41:06 Oh, I'm loving this logic.

James, how do you feel about that? The gap thing, I've never seen you take a gap and also you eat a meal towards the dessert. You don't eat a meal and then have a reward as a dessert afterwards.
Julie Adenuga 41:19 Wait, what do you mean towards the dessert?
Ed Gamble 41:21 He's always thinking about the dessert.
James Acaster 41:23 It's the finish line. That's why I'm doing it. Like you say the reward, but I don't mind the gap because actually a lot of the time..
Ed Gamble 41:31 Never seen you take a gap.
James Acaster 41:32 Yeah, but that's the thing, I ruin it for myself.
Ed Gamble 41:34 Absolute bullshit.
James Acaster 41:36 I ruin it for myself.
Ed Gamble 41:37 You love the gap. Absolutely not true. You're showing off.
James Acaster 41:40 When a gap is imposed on me, I completely appreciate it and it is better. The dessert then tastes better, I'm less full. Sometimes I think to myself: "Come on mate, you can still taste the main course in your mouth. Don't have the dessert, just have a gap so you'll appreciate it more." and I can't do it. My willpower goes, "no no, we're getting the dessert now." And then I eat the dessert. And then I'm like, "Aww." And then I finish the dessert and I'm going: "You can still taste the pesto in your mouth, you idiot. You finished your banana split and you can still taste pesto. Oh, why have you done that to yourself."
James Acaster 41:57 Have you ever double desserted, James?

Are you kidding? Do you know you're speaking to, Julie?
James Acaster 42:24 Would you ask Damon Hill if he's ever driven a car?
Julie Adenuga 42:27 Do you double dessert the same dessert, or do you switch it up the second time?
James Acaster 42:32 If it's good enough, I will double dessert the same dessert. But at the minute, there's a lot of desserts in this flat because I took a crazy week off of desserts, and all that happened is we got more and they stocked up. So now I'm double desserting sometimes. Yesterday, for example... Casting my mind back to yesterday, I had a slice of cherry pie and then afterwards had some cookie dough -- so I double desserted.
Julie Adenuga 42:59 Can I just say, I don't know anyone that's ever eaten a cherry pie? You're the first person I've ever heard.
Ed Gamble 43:05 Well, I ate cherry pie yesterday as well, Julie.
Julie Adenuga 43:07 No, Ed, don't try and jump in now.
Ed Gamble 43:11 We both got sent a cherry pie from Chin Chin ice cream, and they send it frozen and then you defrost it and then put it in the oven for an hour. And it was pretty amazing.
James Acaster 43:21 Amazing. And Ed, I don't know if you ate the whole thing­
Ed Gamble 43:24 Not yet.
James Acaster 43:24 ­when it was hot? We ate half of it when it was hot and the other half I just had cold, didn't warm it up. And that was equally as good.
Ed Gamble 43:32 Oh man. There's some in the fridge. I know I'm going to do it. I'm supposed to...

Ed Gamble 43:35 I had a heavy week. I mean, Easter weekend is a heavy weekend for diabetics if you try and enjoy yourself, because there's a lot of sugar flying around. So Easter Sunday, we had family over to sit in the garden and the cherry pie was kicking around. Then my girlfriend made a pavlova and macarons, and then obviously there's chocolate flying around, bit of ice cream... Which one are you googling, Julie?
Julie Adenuga 43:58 I'm googling Pavlova.
Ed Gamble 44:00 Right, it's like meringue and cream and berries. She made it the shape of a rabbit.
Julie Adenuga 44:04 Your girlfriend made this from scratch?
Ed Gamble 44:06 Yeah.
Julie Adenuga 44:06 Wait, what is this?
James Acaster 44:10 Well, you look at it and tell us what you think it is.
Julie Adenuga 44:14 I have no idea what this is. It just looks like a... cream? Is the cream hard?
Ed Gamble 44:20 No, it's like whipped cream, whipped.
Julie Adenuga 44:21 So how are the fruits balancing on top of something that's not a solid? I'm so confused.
James Acaster 44:27 I think you're confusing the cream and the meringue.
Ed Gamble 44:31 So there's meringue and cream in that.
Julie Adenuga 44:33 Do you lot think I know what meringue is? You're saying 'meringue' to me with the belief that I know what it is.

Ed Gamble 44:39 Well that's one to add to the list, isn't it?
James Acaster 44:41 I'll hold my hands up: I did think you knew what meringue was.
Ed Gamble 44:45 Yeah. Now everyone, when you're sending pictures, you can feel free to throw a meringue picture in there as well.
Julie Adenuga 44:50 Noooo!
James Acaster 44:50 Yeah.
Ed Gamble 44:50 Meringue, mayonnaise, margarine, or marmalade.
James Acaster 44:54 But with the meringue, you have to accompany it with the caption: "what's for pudding?" That's the clue for Julie. That's not one of the main three. The main three -- mayonnaise, marmalade and margarine -- you have to say, "which one is this?" But if you tweet the picture of a meringue, you have to say, "what's for pudding?" And Julie has to not Google it, but has to know that it's meringue and get it right.
James Acaster 45:26 So are we having a Side Dish with this filling Main Course or are we also passing on the Side, having a break, and going to Dessert? What's going on?
Julie Adenuga 45:35 No, we're not passing on the Side, because a Side Dish is just the Main dish that couldn't fit on the same plate as the Main.
Ed Gamble 45:42 That's not true.
Julie Adenuga 45:43 That's what it is.
Ed Gamble 45:44 So as the Side Dish, you'd just have what? Just some more of what you were having as a Main in a little bowl, and call that a Side Dish?

No, but on the Side Dish, I have Plantain or as West Indians pronounce it, "Plantin". And I have it on the side because it can't fit on the plate with the Ground Rice and the Egusi.
James Acaster 45:58 And I know you like that Ed, I know you like that Side Dish.
Ed Gamble 46:01 I do like that side dish, so you've won me over there.
Julie Adenuga 46:03 Oh, is that why you went mad quiet? Because you thought­
Ed Gamble 46:05 Yeah, because I was thinking about it. I was thinking about how nice that sounds. And also, I think it does back up what you're saying, because it goes very nicely with the main dish. So it could be on the same plate, but it's nice to have it there and bring it in when you feel like it.
Julie Adenuga 46:18 Take me off that fucking list please. Take me off that list!
Ed Gamble 46:23 No Starter, you're still on the list. I'm sorry.
Julie Adenuga 46:26 Ridiculous. But yeah, my Side Dish is Plantain because it's sweet, I could eat it by itself to be fair, but it always makes me smile whilst I'm eating. And I think you should be happy when you're eating food.
James Acaster 46:38 I would say that Plantain is becoming maybe the most popular Side Dish we've ever had.
Julie Adenuga 46:44 Oh, is it?
James Acaster 46:44 It's the most frequently mentioned Side Dish. Maybe level with or even more so than chips.
Ed Gamble 46:52 Yeah.
Julie Adenuga 46:53 I don't know if I'd put chips as a side though.
Ed Gamble 46:56 Of course you wouldn't. You'd probably have it as dessert -- your topsy turvy, eating habits.

James Acaster 47:04 I think episode wise, this is the fifth time we've had Plantain as the side dish.
Ed Gamble 47:08 Are you counting unreleased ones as well? 'Cause I think there might but a couple of unreleased ones.
James Acaster 47:11 No, these are just the released ones. I do think there's some unreleased ones that are still to come out with that.
Julie Adenuga 47:16 I can't wait to go to your real restaurant when you guys make it, because there better be Plantain on the menu.
James Acaster 47:21 I mean, it's gonna happen one day, right?
Julie Adenuga 47:23 Has to.
James Acaster 47:23 I reckon, here's what the end game is for this podcast: we open our own restaurants and we'll have done hundreds of episodes by then, and every day the menu is a different episode of the podcast.
Julie Adenuga 47:35 Brilliant! Genius. Genius!
James Acaster 47:38 So basically, we should probably stop at a certain amount, like 300 and something episodes. Not 365, but around that. We have a certain number of days off a year, but each day of the year is a different guests' menu. And then New Year, we start again at the first episode of the podcast, Scroobius Pip, and then we work our way through to whoever the final episode is.
Julie Adenuga 48:01 Can my menu be on my birthday, please? That'd be really great. 'Cause then I can come to the restaurant on my birthday and have my meal.

Ed Gamble 49:34 That's fine. But if you wouldn't mind having the drink with the meal you don't need to worry, on the face of it, if it goes with it.
Julie Adenuga 49:40 Okay. In that case then it's Copella cloudy apple juice.

Ed Gamble 50:00 She's remembered another juice.
Julie Adenuga 50:01 I recently discovered in lockdown. I recently discovered elderflower and apple juice from Copella and wow, what an absolute bazinga!
Julie Adenuga 50:13 Oh it's a bazinga! Listen, people kept telling me to have elderflower with champagne. What's that word you used earlier? Cordial?
James Acaster 50:13 Oh, it's a bazinga?
James Acaster 50:20 Yeah, cordial.
Julie Adenuga 50:22 Put some elderflower cordial in champagne, but I don't like champagne -- I think it tastes like hell. Then I saw it on the apple juice and I was like, "oh, that's going to be disgusting." But no, it was scrumptious. So I'm going to go... No, we're sticking to the originals because we're a natural original group of people: I'm going with Copella cloudy apple juice.
Ed Gamble 50:44 Sometimes Julie, you'll love this, I find apple juice a bit too sweet for me so what I like to do is do half a glass of apple juice and then top it up with sparkling water.

Julie Adenuga 51:59 So Copella, how did I discover... Actually I'm going to shout out Cyan, my good friend Cyan. She was onto Copella cloudy apple juice very early. I actually was dissing her about it for a while. So she was talking about it, like it was the bees knees and I was living in Just Juice land. Now Just Juice over time, I've realised is actually a trash brand for juices. It's really rubbish -- sorry, Just Juice fans. And for a long time I was living in Sun Exotic and Just Juice land. And then I don't know what happened: one day, I just Copella'd and I've never gone back. It is just, it is honestly a great time. So Cyan, I want to publicly apologise to you, for shitting on you, when you knew what the truth was.
James Acaster 52:45 What kind of stuff would you say to her when you used to shit on her for liking Copella juice?
Julie Adenuga 52:51 It wasn't what I said, it was more my face expressions. You guys can tell that I'm normally quite a happy person. You know when you see someone go out of their way for something and in your head, you're thinking, just relax. It was just a very much, just relax, this is not the best thing in the world. Calm down, stop overreacting to your shit juice. And then, I had to eat my words. I might take her some today actually, just as an apology.
James Acaster 53:12 "So I was talking to a couple of absolute idiots today about juice..."
Julie Adenuga 53:17 Only one, only one idiot!
James Acaster 53:18 Thank you.
Ed Gamble 53:22 Outrageous.
James Acaster 53:24 And it made you realise how much of a good friend she was, you want to bring her some cloudy apple Copella juice -- which is now your favourite drink.
Ed Gamble 53:30 I think the cloudy makes the juice grown-up. Do you know what I mean? I think if you were saying to anyone else, "I'm having an apple juice." I think that sounds a bit like quite a childish drink choice, but the fact that you want the cloudy apple juice makes it sound a bit more refined, a bit more grown-up.

James Acaster 53:48 Interesting.
Ed Gamble 53:49 I still think it's a fucking disgrace of a choice, but...
James Acaster 53:56 I think one of my favourite drink moments, I really remember it very vividly. One morning, just a normal morning like any other, I woke up and I didn't brush my teeth or anything, I just went straight downstairs. I'd forgotten... Normally I'd brush my teeth before having breakfast, but I didn't do it that morning. I just woke up and walked down stairs, forgot, poured myself a glass of apple juice, took a swig, and it was like, someone had taken like those defibrillators and put them on my tongue. Electric shock to my tongue. It tasted so whoa, like my tongue just went from being all scummy and like, y'know, asleep and all covered in whatever. And then: whoa, it just woke up and it just felt so good. And I was like, this is the best feeling in the world -- I love apple juice straight away in the morning now. And it was like, I never really recreated it again but that first time it happened, it felt so good. I thought, wow, this is such a sensation.
Julie Adenuga 54:45 I am speechless that that even had a name -- that it was called a 'drink moment'.
Ed Gamble 54:50 A 'drink moment' for James, yeah.
James Acaster 54:52 A 'drink moment' for me.
Julie Adenuga 54:54 And then it actually turned into... It was a drink moment. I didn't even know how you were gonna land with that one but you landed, it was impressive.

James Acaster 55:22 I'm chasing the dragon. I'm chasing that Apple dragon.
Ed Gamble 55:29 You should wake up in the middle of the night and try and surprise your body and have a swig of apple juice.
James Acaster 55:33 I should ask my girlfriend, because I always have a glass of water by the side of the bed. I should say to her, just one night a year, don't tell me what night it is, switch that glass for apple juice. Don't tell me about it. And in the night when I can't see what I'm drinking, I'll have a swig, I'll be like: "woohoo, it's the drink moment! It happened again!"
Ed Gamble 55:50 And you know what? I think because it's you, if you said to your girlfriend: "Switch my water with apple juice one night in the year, don't tell me when." She would not bat an eyelid. She'd be like, "All right, yeah. Of course you're asking me that."

Julie Adenuga 56:26 I like that -- although Nigerian restaurants don't have beer gardens, James, they just have gardens.
James Acaster 56:31 Okay.
Julie Adenuga 56:32 I think there'd just be an outdoor section. I don't know if we'd call it a beer garden. I think there'd be­
James Acaster 56:36 Apple juice garden?
Julie Adenuga 56:37 Oh. Nah.
James Acaster 56:38 Copella garden?
Julie Adenuga 56:39 It'd just be the outdoor... It'd be the outdoor after-party section, that's what it would be. There'd be a DJ out there, definitely be a DJ out there.
James Acaster 56:46 Who's DJing in the Dream Restaurant?
Julie Adenuga 56:48 Oooh? Easy, I think? If we're gonna pick someone at the Nigerian restaurant... Actually no, it's not easy. At the Nigerian restaurant, who is DJing? Black Coffee. That's a good vibe, I think.
James Acaster 57:00 Appropriately named for your drink course.
Ed Gamble 57:04 Would you like your apple juice to be sponsored by Apple, to plug your radio show?

No.

Ed Gamble 57:13 Are we going to look back and find out every single course is deliberately designed to plug something in your career?
Julie Adenuga 57:20 I would never do that on purpose.
Ed Gamble 57:22 For your Side Dish, I'd like one beetroot -- so Beats 1.
James Acaster 57:25 Yeah, very good.
Julie Adenuga 57:28 I can't believe how much I hate you.
Ed Gamble 57:32 Yeah, I was gonna ask you if you wanted ice in it before realising what a dumb question that was.
Julie Adenuga 57:37 At least you've been listening to me.
Ed Gamble 57:39 I've been taking it in. You don't want dirty tap water in your apple juice.
Julie Adenuga 57:45 Stop making it sound like it's a bad thing that I don't want dirty tap water in there. I just don't want it.
Ed Gamble 57:52 No, I think that's one of the things that's genuinely gonna change my outlook on things. When anyone brings me a glass of water with ice in it, I don't think I'll be able to drink it without thinking: Julie Adenuga said this is dirty tap water.
James Acaster 58:06 We arrive at the desert, I'm feeling good about this -- you and I, both? It's the reward, like you said. I really like your philosophy on the whole meal, the meal as a whole. I think you've been right about every course. I'm looking forward to hearing what the dessert is.

Oh no, that's a lot of pressure, James.
Ed Gamble 58:23 Yeah. It's calamari, isn't it?
Julie Adenuga 58:28 No, it's the greatest dessert of all time. There are no arguments about this. I think every single restaurant in the world should have this dessert.
James Acaster 58:36 I love this build up.
Julie Adenuga 58:37 There's no reason to not have it -- and when done correctly it honestly tastes like heaven. My dessert is an Apple Crumble with Custard. Not an apple-almond-rhubarb crumble, not fucking an apple crumble with a nought .1% layer of crumble and heaps of apple. A fucking equal or more crumble. Apple crumble with warm custard, not ice cream. Never ice cream. If you bring me apple crumble with ice cream, I will throw it on the floor, and I will hope that some of it splashes up onto your face.
Ed Gamble 59:23 Well, if you throw apple crumble with ice cream on the floor, I'm going to get on the floor and open my mouth.
Julie Adenuga 59:29 Why?
Ed Gamble 59:30 Because it's delicious. It is the only thing to have with apple crumble.

Fuck. With crumble, okay, you need the ratios to be correct. You either want more crumble or equal to the apple. You never want less crumble.
Ed Gamble 1:01:47 Agree with that.
Julie Adenuga 1:01:48 The reason why the custard works so well with the crumble is because when you pour it on top, the way the custard seeps into the crumble, it's like a marriage of fucking beauty and fucking deliciousness. It cannot be replicated in any other way, and then when you push your spoon through the custard, through the crumble, into the apple, it's just like the earth's core. You know how hot the earth's core is. It just feels and tastes and looks like what happiness is.
Ed Gamble 1:02:27 You like the way it seeps in?
Ed Gamble 1:02:29 No, of course it does.
Julie Adenuga 1:02:29 It's all of it. You know when they showed you a cross-section of the earth and you can see the magnus rock and the something, and it looks beautiful. When it's ice cream- Just a bowl or a scoop of fucking shit ice cream. It doesn't seep. It just sits on top.
Julie Adenuga 1:02:47 No, it doesn't.
Ed Gamble 1:02:48 Julie, it melts. What ice cream are you talking about?
Julie Adenuga 1:02:50 No, that's my point. When ice cream melts, it's just bullshit. Melted ice cream is bullshit. Have you not noticed that? Melted ice cream is cream and that is shit. Cream on a crumble is bollocks. So when you have the scoop of the ice cream with the crumble, they don't merge. It's just smashing two solids together. It's pointless and stupid. And you, Ed­
Ed Gamble 1:03:15 Lying, you're just lying about it.
Julie Adenuga 1:03:16 You, Ed, are getting a mute and a block on social media for your ridiculous preferences. I'm really upset that you eat ice cream and apple crumble. That's really upset me. Out of everything you've said today, that is upsetting.

Ed Gamble 1:03:31 All through that little rant there that you had about custard and crumble, I was just thinking about having vanilla ice cream on hot apple crumble.
Julie Adenuga 1:03:38 Look how basic you are. You're basic. You're such a basic bitch.
Ed Gamble 1:03:42 I'm not a basic bitch.
Ed Gamble 1:03:43 Yeah, I would.
James Acaster 1:03:43 I do think that if you're going to put ice cream on an apple crumble, which I personally would not do, I'd choose the cold custard. I think you do have to choose vanilla ice cream if you are doing it.
James Acaster 1:03:43 I think that is the flavour you should choose.
Ed Gamble 1:03:56 Yeah.
Julie Adenuga 1:03:56 Do whatever, it doesn't matter because you shouldn't do it anyway. That's like saying, if you are going to kill someone, you should shoot them in their head. Well you shouldn't even kill anyone in the first place so whatever you're going to do it's bollocks. Whether it's vanilla ice cream, strawberry, chocolate, it doesn't matter. It's all stupid and it shouldn't be done and Ed, I'm going to make you change your mind because it makes me angry that you are living a life with crumble and ice cream. You're just waking up in the morning and thinking that that's normal. It really infuriates me.
Ed Gamble 1:04:27 I'll be honest, you pretty quickly went to shooting someone in the head while you were talking there. You are pretty angry about this.
James Acaster 1:04:37 It's just an example that she happened to pluck out of the air.

Ed, when you were listening to Julie's description there, didn't you think that the description of the custard and how evenly it covers the crumble... Even though the ice cream melts, it's not covering everything evenly.

Julie Adenuga 1:05:01 You need to give James a moment of silence after that, because that was like Einstein with E=mc2.
Ed Gamble 1:05:09 Yeah, I'll give him a moment of silence to commemorate the death of an idea.
James Acaster 1:05:14 MC squared, right?
Julie Adenuga 1:05:16 That was genius, genius thinking.
Ed Gamble 1:05:18 You don't want everything evenly covered. You want some spoons with just crumble, some spoons with just apple, some with just apple and crumble, and then some spoons with the ice cream, the apple, the crumble.
Julie Adenuga 1:05:29 What is he talking about?
James Acaster 1:05:30 Any time, I've been in the situation where there's been ice cream on a crumble or something, all I'm thinking is about the ratios all the way through. I'm thinking, "oh, it's not melting fast. I'm going to have a big load of ice cream on it's own at the end."
Ed Gamble 1:05:42 Oh that's a problem for you now, is it James? Are you kidding me? Suddenly you don't want a load of ice cream by itself at the end? That's your life. Your life is a big load of ice cream at the end.

If you want to eat ice cream by itself, then do that. If you want to eat an apple crumble by itself, then do that.
Ed Gamble 1:05:58 I will, and I'll put them together.
Julie Adenuga 1:05:59 You can't put a lump of ice cream next to it and think, "Sometimes I'm going to get a bit of crumble by itself. Sometimes I'm going to get a mixture of all three. Sometimes..." It's like, what you're doing?! What is it that you want to do today?
Ed Gamble 1:06:11 Right. Good impression of me, first of all, well done.
Julie Adenuga 1:06:15 No, I'm sorry. To me that just sounds like you're a very indecisive person who doesn't actually know what they want in life. So what you do is you give yourself options within your one dessert, of having ice cream by itself, crumble by itself, or a mix. That's silly. That's that's why you like starters, because you don't actually know what you want so you get starters and then you're like, "Hmm, this was all right, but I'm not going to have it for my main," and then you get a different main.
Ed Gamble 1:06:37 I'm ambitious, Julie, I want it all.
James Acaster 1:06:39 She's destroyed it.
James Acaster 1:06:40 I want it all, Julie. I want to have a taste of everything. Why not?
Julie Adenuga 1:06:46 No, that's wrong, Ed. If you want something, you go and you get it. If you want apple crumble and ice cream, you should have one where the ice cream and the crumble come together as one. They're a unit.
Ed Gamble 1:06:57 Yeah, I want apple crumble, I want ice cream. I don't want the two together. I don't want what you want, which is a big load of a bowl of sludge, is what you want. You want a bowl of sludge. You want to take all the crisp out the crumble, by covering it in custard and you want to mix it all up and you want to eat it like you're in an old people's home, and I for one think it's absolutely disgusting.

Ed Gamble 1:07:29 No, I want some crispy, I want some not crispy. I want to be able to vary it. I'm sorry. I want a life of variety.
Julie Adenuga 1:07:36 No, you're one of them people that just- you like social media, innit?

James Acaster 1:07:55 Well, that is the harshest attack anyone's ever heard on this podcast.

Julie Adenuga 1:08:04 You and sparkling water, but it's the same same, Ed. It's the same same.
James Acaster 1:08:09 It's the most aggressive attack that's ever been on the podcast and I still don't understand why it started with the social media.
Ed Gamble 1:08:18 No, me neither.
James Acaster 1:08:20 Absolutely no idea what that had to do with liking ice cream on an apple crumble. "Oh you're the kind of person who likes social media and you like all of your followers and you're what's wrong with the world." What?
Julie Adenuga 1:08:34 You set me off on a tangent. This is how passionate I am about crumble and custard. Look what it makes me do, it makes me shout at people that I actually like. I really like you, Ed.

Main Course: Ground Rice, made by your dad, with Beef, Egusi Stew and Tomato Stew on top, made by your mum. Side Dish: Plantain. Drink: Copella cloudy apple juice, out in the garden, Black Coffee's DJ. Dessert: Apple Crumble -- more or equal crumble to the amount of apple -- with warm custard on top?
