Ed Gamble 00:13 Welcome to the Off Menu podcast. Just five minutes in bubbly chat creates the perfect soft boiled conversation.
James Acaster 00:21 Hm.
Ed Gamble 00:22 No?
James Acaster 00:23 Uhh, yeah?
Ed Gamble 00:24 All right, you do an egg one.
James Acaster 00:26 Welcome to the Off Menu podcast. Cracking stuff.
Ed Gamble 00:30 No, awful! Really, really bad! Really bad. Look, mine wasn't great in terms of like, the intros that we've done in the past. It wasn't great. It sounded like I was trying to be poetic. I wasn't, I was just trying to do something. But cracking stuff is really bad, it's ironically very bad stuff.
James Acaster 00:46 Okay, well you don't understand it because -
Ed Gamble 00:48 I do. It's cracking like an egg, you crack an egg.
James Acaster 00:50 - okay, well you're halfway there.
James Acaster 00:50 Right -
Ed Gamble 00:50 Yeah.
Ed Gamble 00:51 You crack an egg, and now cracking can mean good.

James Acaster 00:57 Well, think... think about it again, then, and laugh because that's funny!
Ed Gamble 01:00 No, because it's bad! It's bad stuff.
James Acaster 01:02 Okay, well, you're in the wrong business baby!
James Acaster 01:04 You're in the wrong business. [Ed laughs]
Ed Gamble 01:04 It's bad.
Ed Gamble 01:07 Don't you "baby" me! Welcome to the Off Menu podcast. It's Ed Gamble and James Acaster, with a little bit of our classic double act repartee there. James, what's this podcast about?
James Acaster 01:16 We have a dream.
Ed Gamble 01:18 Oh. We have a dream. Right. Yes, it's about Martin Luther King, our podcast.
James Acaster 01:23 Sorry -
Ed Gamble 01:24 We have a dream.
James Acaster 01:25 I was gonna say "we have a special guest in the dream restaurant" -

Ed Gamble 01:32 We do have a dream guest!
James Acaster 01:33 - and then I thought to myself, yeah we do have a dream guest, actually. So maybe keep that in. And then before I get myself - my brain short circuited!
Ed Gamble 01:34 Yeah.
James Acaster 01:41 I don't normally have to think of an intro, and "Cracking stuff" really took it out of me! I deserved it! I criticised you're intro, I deserve to have it blow up in my face like this.
Ed Gamble 01:51 Yeah, you did. We have a dream.
James Acaster 01:53 We have a dream! That the dream guests comes into our dream restaurant and orders their dream meal, consisting of their favourite ever: starter, main course, dessert, side dish and drink!
Ed Gamble 02:02 And todays dream is...

Very excited indeed to hear - I mean, Bimini is also a vegan. So we should get loads of vegan recommendations here. Every now and again, we have a vegan on the podcast. And, you know, hey! Guys! We should get more vegans on, to be fair.
Ed Gamble 02:42 I mean, that's us saying that - we're in charge of who's on the podcast. We're telling ourselves to do something that we could be doing.
James Acaster 02:48 But here's the thing. The Great Bonito is a vegetarian and he hates vegans!
Ed Gamble 02:52 Yes!
James Acaster 02:53 And so it's very hard to get vegans past him, because he has such allegiance to the vegetarian flag.
Ed Gamble 03:00 The amount of times we've had vegans on this podcast and we've not been able to release the episode because every course they order, Benito comes on to the recording and he goes "have a cube of cheese, you little shit!"
James Acaster 03:10 Yep! He tries to feed people cheese -
Ed Gamble 03:13 Yeah.
James Acaster 03:13 - and milk. He's a bad little boy. And we have to apologise countless times. For this episode, we had to lock him in a cupboard -
James Acaster 03:24 - and get rid of him so that he wasn't in the room. Listen, we're excited to have Bimini Bon Boulash in the dream restaurant. However, if she says the secret ingredient - which we have decided is something that we don't like - we have to kick around the dream restaurant.
Ed Gamble 03:24 We did.
James Acaster 03:25 And this week, the secret ingredient is: Gimini Gon Goulash.

Ed Gamble 03:44 If Bimini Bon Boulash says Gimini Gon Goulash, Bimini Bon Boulash is out on her ash.
James Acaster 03:49 Not bad.
Ed Gamble 03:50 Not bad?
James Acaster 03:51 Actually, really good. Yeah, I could see a little bit of panic in your eyes before getting to the last line, thinking "what am I gonna say?"
Ed Gamble 03:57 Yeah.
James Acaster 03:58 And I'm guessing you thought of "ash". It was definitely gonna be "out on her ash" -
Ed Gamble 04:02 Yeah, now "dash" - I should have said "dash", really.
James Acaster 04:04 But you were like, "Uh oh, I can't - it begins with an "A" so I can't really make the full line work.
James Acaster 04:09 I can't go, "a-a-ashally ash oosh ash ash". But then you went with "out on her ash."
Ed Gamble 04:09 No.
Ed Gamble 04:15 Yeah.
James Acaster 04:16 And that worked.
Ed Gamble 04:17 It's no "Eddy Cheddy Ready for Beddy" or whatever it is, but it'll do for now.

James Acaster 04:27 Okay? "Bready Cheddy and Ready for Beddy" -
Ed Gamble 04:29 Yeah.
James Acaster 04:30 That - you're never gonna beat that. And that's fine!
Ed Gamble 04:33 That was so long ago as well. And I've achieved nothing since then.
James Acaster 04:36 Well, you know, there's loads of - there's loads of geniuses like that, Ed. Who have, you know, early on in their career done something that - do you know what, if it makes you feel any better: yeah, you've never done anything as good since - but neither has any other podcaster.
Ed Gamble 04:49 That's true.
James Acaster 04:50 No one else in podcasting has said anything as good as "Bready Cheddy and Ready for Beddy" since you said it. I include myself in that number!
Ed Gamble 04:56 Oh, yeah, me too. Bimini's book is called "A Drag Queen's Guide to Life". It is available for pre-order now and look out for new music coming from Bimini soon...

James Acaster 05:14 Off Menu menu of Bimini Bon -
Ed Gamble 05:17 We didn't explain what Gimini Gon Goulash is.
James Acaster 05:19 Oh, yes. Before we go into this: goulash is really that secret ingredient, but we couldn't resist having a dish that rhymed with Bimin's name. And we thought of goulash, so then we went for Gimini Gon Goulash. But let's just say, any goulash.
Ed Gamble 05:33 Do you think - are we stupid? Are we thick idiots James? I just -
James Acaster 05:36 Yeah, well -
Ed Gamble 05:37 - sometimes I think we're absolute thick idiots, aren't we?
James Acaster 05:38 Listen. If anyone is listening to this podcast and they've never heard the Off Menu podcast before, and they're a big fan of Bimini's and they're here to listen to her, and then they hear this intro, they're gonna think "well, this will be the only episode of this podcast we ever listen to. Because these two absolutely stupid. They've messed up every single job they had to do in this intro. And they've taken it in turns of mess it up as well."
James Acaster 05:39 It started badly. The guy who started it was rightly told off by the other guy.
James Acaster 06:03 Yeah.
Ed Gamble 06:03 Who then tried to prove his point by being worse.
James Acaster 06:05 Yeah. And then that theme continued for the whole thing. At one point they said one of the best things that either of them have ever said is "Bready, Cheddy and Ready for Beddy". If that's the highlight of this podcast, I'm not going back and re-listening to the whole thing. And then they led into the podcast the main body of it - and then they remembered there was something I forgot to do. And then they went back and did it. And now they're completely second guessing everything they've said in the intro.

And all I tuned in for was to listen to Bimini on a podcast ,and it's taking ages to get to Bimini because they're still talking shit about Gimini Gon Goulash which isn't even a thing.
James Acaster 06:37 Which no one cared about the first time.
Ed Gamble 06:39 Anyway. Should we? Here we go then. Podcast.
James Acaster 06:42 [Sings] Podcast!
Ed Gamble 06:51 Bimini Bon Boulash, welcome to the dream restaurant.
Bimini Bon Boulash 06:55 Alright babes! Thank you for having me!
James Acaster 06:58 [Explosion sound effect] Welcome, Bimini Bon Boulash! To the dream restaurant! We've been expecting you for some time.
Ed Gamble 07:03 That was James as the Genie Waiter making his fantastic appearance. Unfortunately, because of some internet issues - we'll just let the listener know - we can't see each other today. We can only hear each other. So you're just going to have to imagine what James looks like as a genie, because he's properly dressed up for you and everything.
James Acaster 07:17 Yes.
Bimini Bon Boulash 07:18 Awww, well I'm gutted to miss it. Yeah, we've got some internet issues going over in North East London. So, it's out of my hands.
James Acaster 07:25 What are you imagining my genie outfit to look like, Bimini?
Bimini Bon Boulash 07:28 I hope you've got some shoes on that have got those little - it kind of curls up at the end like a really long toenail.

James Acaster 07:48 That's exactly what I'm wearing.
Ed Gamble 07:49 Yeah.
Bimini Bon Boulash 07:49 Good.
Ed Gamble 07:50 Apart from the bells on the nipples, you got you got everything. The little nipple bells are quite prominent.
James Acaster 07:56 Yes.
Bimini Bon Boulash 07:56 The eyes are the nipples of the face.

James Acaster 08:07 You much of a food fan, Bimini?
Bimini Bon Boulash 08:09 Yeah, no I am very much. Too much of a food fan sometimes. But I'm also vegan.

I was just - it was just like, we've got to two minutes or something of talking and I hadn't told you I was vegan yet. And it was - I've been like itching. It's been, it's been difficult keeping it in.
Ed Gamble 08:26 To be fair, I think a lot of vegans worry about that. And they always have to mention that "Oh, I'm always banging on about being vegan!" because they're worried that's what everyone else is thinking. But this is a food podcast, so it'd be weird if you didn't mention it.
Bimini Bon Boulash 08:36 It's part of the manifesto. It's part of what we sign up to at the beginning.
James Acaster 08:40 Oh, I've got to ask you this -
Bimini Bon Boulash 08:42 Go on.
James Acaster 08:42 - very important question you ask all vegans. Who are the top three best vegans?
Bimini Bon Boulash 08:46 Ooh, obviously me at number one. I think Pamela Anderson can get a close... she can - she just misses out on the title of The Number One Vegan. And I think as well Lewis Hamilton's doing some good stuff with their platform in terms of veganism. So, I think Lewis Hamilton can have a bronze medal.
James Acaster 09:03 Lovely.
Ed Gamble 09:04 I had absolutely no idea that Lewis Hamilton was vegan. I don't know why I associate driving fast with meat eating.
James Acaster 09:10 He's got "ham" is his name.
Ed Gamble 09:11 He's got "ham" in his name!
Bimini Bon Boulash 09:12 He's breaking boundaries! He's pushing it, he's pushing it. He's not what you'd expect and I think it's really cool.

Do you think he could get to the top spot if he changed his name? So it didn't have "ham" in it anymore?
Bimini Bon Boulash 09:24 Maybe if it was Louis Vegamilton
Ed Gamble 09:27 Vegamilton.
Bimini Bon Boulash 09:28 Louis Vegamilton. Yeah, Vegamilton.
James Acaster 09:30 Also would you like to go and see that musical, Bimini? Would you go and see Vegamilton?
Bimini Bon Boulash 09:34 Maybe. I'm not that big on musicals. The only musical I really like is Hedwig and The Angry Inch. I think that's quite cool musical. And obviously Rocky Horror Picture Show. That's a good one. But in terms of musicals, they're not really my cup of tea.
Ed Gamble 09:46 Was that hard in drag race then? When you had to - because there's always like, musical challenges and stuff, aren't there?
Bimini Bon Boulash 09:51 Yeah. Well, we did the musical challenge and obviously for anyone that did watch it, you'll know that my talents weren't in the vocals. But it was more the punk energy.
Bimini Bon Boulash 10:00 Yeah, it was the attitude. And that's important as well when you're, when you're a musician. Like, it's not all about having the perfect vocals. You've got to bring, you've got to bring the energy. You've got to bring the attitude.
Ed Gamble 10:00 Attitude.
James Acaster 10:01 It's what punk's about.
Ed Gamble 10:10 That's my attitude to stand up comedy as well: no, I'm not funny, but I'm quite loud.

Bimini Bon Boulash 10:15 I mean, we had to do a stand up comedy challenge with an empty room. With no audience. So that was difficult.
James Acaster 10:21 Well that's like Ed's entire Edinburgh run, isn't it Ed?
Ed Gamble 10:24 Yeah. [extended laughter]
James Acaster 10:29 So we always start with still or sparkling water.
Bimini Bon Boulash 10:31 Always sparkling. Because I think it just adds that level of glamour to a glass of water that you need at all times. And I actually carry around my own metallic straw. So if the restaurant doesn't have a metal straw, I can pop it in me sparkling water at all times.
James Acaster 10:49 I love this. Now, this straw. Is it just a standard, just metal tube?
Bimini Bon Boulash 10:55 Chrome, yeah. Silver. This one's silver, I use it a minute, but I do chop and change between gold or pink. It really just depends on the day.
James Acaster 11:03 Now, is that a pink straw? Or is it like, a rose gold straw?
Bimini Bon Boulash 11:07 Oh, never rose gold! Never rose gold.
Ed Gamble 11:13 How dare you, James.
James Acaster 11:13 Never rose gold!
Bimini Bon Boulash 11:14 Never rose gold! No, I'm not into that like pinky dust - no, I like dusty pink but not a rose gold. Not for me, that one.

Ed Gamble 11:34 Oh no.
Bimini Bon Boulash 11:35 What a hypocrite!
Ed Gamble 11:36 Isn't it nice in this day and age that people can carry around metallic straws for sustainably drinking sparkling water; whereas if you saw someone in the 70s with the metallic straw, we all knew what that was for.
Bimini Bon Boulash 11:45 Well it has multi-usage. [extended laughter] That's what we need with sustainability. We can't just have one product that does one thing, you need them to have various reasons for existing.
James Acaster 11:57 So, you want sparkling water with your own -
Bimini Bon Boulash 12:00 Yep.
James Acaster 12:01 - metallic straw that you've brought along yourself as well.
Bimini Bon Boulash 12:03 Can I have a slice of lime?
James Acaster 12:05 Oh -

Is it always lime over lemon for you, Bimini?

James Acaster 12:15 The straw comes out again. [Bimini laughs]
Bimini Bon Boulash 12:17 It's always lime over lemon for me, I would say. Actually, no that's a lie! Lemon first thing in the morning. But if I'm being, if I'm at a restaurant, I like to have lime in my sparkling water because I feel like it's a bit edgier than a lemon.
James Acaster 12:29 Yeah.
Bimini Bon Boulash 12:29 I feel like lime's got more of a - like a bit cooler, aren't they, limes?
Ed Gamble 12:33 Bit more punk?
James Acaster 12:33 Yep.
Bimini Bon Boulash 12:34 Bit more punk. Yeah, they've got an attitude.
James Acaster 12:36 I'm intrigued with this lemon in the morning, lime in the evening thing.
Bimini Bon Boulash 12:40 Mm.
James Acaster 12:40 At what time of day, does it switch over from lemon to lime?
Bimini Bon Boulash 12:44 It depends on what I've been up to, if I'm honest, but I do think I'm one for a fad. So if someone tells me, I have to drink a glass of lemon water at room temperature first thing in the morning: I'll do it every single day. If they tell me it's good for me. That's the kind of person I am, I think. So, I would say - I'd say when it starts get a bit darker. I think when it gets a bit darker, that's when you go for the lime.

James Acaster 13:06 Yeah. Because then who's to know, you know? It's darker at that point. Is it a lemon? Is it a lime? People can't call you out.
Bimini Bon Boulash 13:13 Is it an orange? [Ed laughs]
James Acaster 13:14 Is it an orange?
Bimini Bon Boulash 13:16 Like, what is it? Is it - are you having an aperol spritz? O are you having a sparkling water? Like who knows at this point.
Ed Gamble 13:23 That's weird isn't it, about the - why is it the lemon and the lime that people are so into when it comes to water? Because if someone brought you a glass of water, it has a lemon or lime in it, you're not going to bat an eyelid right? But if they brought you a big slice of orange and a glass of water, you're going to complain.
Bimini Bon Boulash 13:36 You might complain or you might think they're being really cool or edgy. But I think it really comes down to like - I was unnaturally ginger, and I think people are just offended by orange and like that tone and that shade. I think people just have a fixation with it. So I would say it's - I think, justice for orange.
James Acaster 13:53 It's prejudice. People don't want the orange in the water because of their own prejudice against gingerhaired people.
Bimini Bon Boulash 13:58 Yeah, quote me on that. I said it.
Ed Gamble 14:00 Or a carrot. That's why people don't want a big carrot sticking out the water either.
James Acaster 14:03 Yeah?
Bimini Bon Boulash 14:04 I've got called "carrot top" loads. So I think that is, I think that is. Although I had a spiced carrot - I know this is off topic but I had a spiced carrot in Margate this weekend. And it was the best carrot I've ever had in my entire life.

I don't think this is off topic, I'm loving it.
Ed Gamble 14:16 Not off topic at all. This is bang on topic, Bimini. Take us through the spiced carrot.
Bimini Bon Boulash 14:20 It also had this kind of like yoghurt pesto base. And it was like, soft in the middle, but a bit hard on the outside. And it was covered in like, all the different like - cinnamon and cumin spices, and it was just cooked to perfection. And we were all just like, "this is the best carrot I've ever had". And it was a whole carrot as well. So it was like a big old carrot, they hadn't tried to chop it up or anything. It was just mind blowing. Honestly, I can't remember the restaurant. I can't remember where it was. It was on a rooftop in Margate and they've just opened up the place. It was bloody freezing. But the carrot was gorgeous. Chef's kiss. [Bimini does a chef's kiss]
James Acaster 14:52 Sounds great!
Ed Gamble 14:53 That's what's getting the - some really good just like, vegan cooking happening at the moment where chefs like, treat the vegetables - like whole vegetables - almost as if they're meat and like baste them and you know cook them in amazing spices and stuff. And I I myself had a big roast cauliflower the other day, Bimini.
Bimini Bon Boulash 15:07 I love cauliflower. It's so versatile
Ed Gamble 15:10 Oh man.
Bimini Bon Boulash 15:10 It is good. Cauliflower chicken - like, you can make vegan cauliflower wings. Buffalo wings. Ah! They are incredible. They're one of my favourite like little starter things to make. But there's other - I think you're true like, I think we've become accustomed to like hundreds of years of cooking very meat-based - especially here in Britain, we're very like, where it's like meat and two veg. I think people are trying. People are being more experimental with carrots. And I was, I just couldn't believe that the carrot's had this injustice its entire life when it could taste that good.
James Acaster 15:41 Would you like the spiced carrot that you had on the rooftop as an amuse-bouche for this meal?
Bimini Bon Boulash 15:47 Yeah, why not? Because... do you know what? I feel bad for my lovely mom who is incredible, but she can't make a carrot. It's always either too hard. Or just like, it's basically raw and this carrot was like... it was - there was love in this carrot.

Ed Gamble 16:04 Yeah.
Bimini Bon Boulash 16:05 I can't stop thinking about it.
James Acaster 16:07 I'm watching The Walking Dead at the minute. And there's a scene in that, that I saw the other day when one of the characters says to the other one "there's three pots of boiling water. In one of them, I put a carrot. In the other one, I put an egg. And in the third one I put coffee grounds. The carrot went in hard and came out soft. The egg went in soft and came out hard. The coffee grounds change the water itself."
Ed Gamble 16:31 So what does that mean, James?
James Acaster 16:33 Not really keeping up with The Walking Dead very well. It's confusing. A lot of it is like, going over my head. But I thought that sounded pretty profound when they said that.
Ed Gamble 16:41 I love that you're clearly not watching any of this stuff with zombies, you're like zoning out and looking at your phone and stuff. And the only time we've concentrated is sort of quite a bullshit proverb about carrots.
James Acaster 16:49 Well, I'm used to listening about food all the time now. Because of this podcast, whenever anyone mentions food -
Bimini Bon Boulash 16:55 Maybe it's, you're not meant to judge something by its colour because you don't know how it's gonna turn out. Maybe that's what that means.
Ed Gamble 17:01 That's good.
James Acaster 17:01 I think so.

Bimini Bon Boulash 17:10 Let's go with... bread.
Ed Gamble 17:13 I can tell you know your food, you think about this a lot. What sort of bread are we going with? You have a specific type of bread? Do you have bread from a certain place that you love the most?
Bimini Bon Boulash 17:21 Yeah so see the thing is, right, I think ultimately, you can try all these different types of breads and some of them are gorgeous - shout out to the expensive sourdoughs that I've eaten in Dalston. But... I will say, I don't know if you can beat a white crusty roll.
James Acaster 17:38 Yeah.
Bimini Bon Boulash 17:38 A white, crusty roll that crumbles when you eat it. There was a shop that I remember growing up as a kid - and I think this is why I've got this like, this this memory of it - that I used to go every Saturday to my aunty's house. And it was just like a little corner shop, but they made this like fresh bread in the mornings. And we would get like, these crusty rolls - just with butter as well like, not even with anything inside just like the crusty roll warm with butter. And it's - I honestly don't think you can beat that.
James Acaster 18:06 Yeah.
Ed Gamble 18:07 I mean, you've convinced me. I've just - I went somewhere else when you were describing that that warm crusty roll there. That sounds absolutely amazing.
Bimini Bon Boulash 18:13 Yeah it's like, it's a bit basic, but I do often as well if you have a soup and you pop in it a white crusty roll with a bit of butter on, in your soap. You can't beat that. I mean that's just like, that's just like mouth watering stuff right there and i think - i think a white question is underrated. I think probably a lot of people will try and go really fancy with like - to tell you about the breads and I have had many a bread in my time but I will say I just don't think you can beat it.

James Acaster 18:38 What kind of butter you have on it. Salted, unsalted?
Bimini Bon Boulash 18:41 Well vegan butter, obviously and also there's there's a there's a Sainsbury's do this really bangin vegan butter now, and it comes in like a slab of butter. And it's hard like how butter would be and it tastes and it spreads just like it, it's really it's like the closest closest I've had to kind of that Lurpak experience that I grew up with so I think yeah, it was obviously being the vegan butter, salted always because I put salt on everything.
James Acaster 19:08 Here's an important question. Do you bake?
Bimini Bon Boulash 19:11 I have baked in my time some some really terrible attempts but um yeah, I have baked
James Acaster 19:16 I have a business proposition for you Bimini. Would you like to open a bakery with me called Bakery Bun Boo Lash,
Bimini Bon Boulash 19:23 Bakery Bun Boo Lash or Bimini, run by Bimini Bun Bakery. Yeah, let's do it. Yeah,
James Acaster 19:30 I think there'd be a queue out the door. I think we'd sell a lot of crusty white roll
Bimini Bon Boulash 19:35 Yeah, crusty white rolls, that needs to be like the main source of the the hype that we build around it, because I think everyone goes to fancy now, I think we just need to bring back a bit simplicity. Yeah, I say that while I'm like in this white faux fur coat and like, not really simple. But yeah.
James Acaster 19:53 I say we only serve the crusty white roles because I personally, I don't know what you think about this. I like the places that just do unlimited. menu now the less stuff on the menu, the better.
James Acaster 20:02 Because you know it's good.
James Acaster 20:03 You know, it's good.
Bimini Bon Boulash 20:04 Yeah. And like you can, you can maybe switch it up in a few months time if you fancy it. But ultimately, people come for the food that they know they're gonna love. That's why I go back to some of the

restaurants I go to is because I know that I'm going to get good stuff. I like places that have their like main things on the menu, and then maybe sometimes they'll switch a few dishes around. But like, ultimately, if I'm going back for years, I want to be having the same stuff because food brings nostalgia.
Ed Gamble 20:28 Exactly. It's like you're saying about the buns remind you of your Auntie's house and stuff. And these are the buns that you can serve at the Bimini Bun Bakery. I'm thinking shelves have those and you're wearing the white faux coat as well to serve them. So it's white rolls white walls, white coat,
Bimini Bon Boulash 20:44 and I'm actually wearing a bra and panty two piece made out of strictly white crusty rolls.
Ed Gamble 20:50 Perfect. What would you like James to wear? Because obviously, he's going to be there helping out? Yeah. Is he going to be dressed as the genie? Or does he need something else to fit in more?
Bimini Bon Boulash 20:57 Well, we'll see. Do you know what I think James? I think you dress in whatever you feel makes you feel comfortable. If you want to be the genie you can be the genie you can be the genie of your own life.
James Acaster 21:06 I feel like if we're working at the bakery together, and you've got your outfit on that you just described. I'm going to feel a little bit out of place if I'm not wearing the same thing. So if that's the uniform,
Bimini Bon Boulash 21:17 okay, well we'll make you like either a thong.
James Acaster 21:20 Yeah.
Bimini Bon Boulash 21:20 out of the white crusty roll or like kind of a ball wrap mankini out of white crusty rolls, like that kind of vibe.
Ed Gamble 21:27 Yes. How's a thong gonna work made of the white crusty roll? Would it have to be like uncooked dough? For the bit of the back?
Bimini Bon Boulash 21:34 I do love uncooked dough. I do. I feel like, sometimes I feel like uncooked dough is better than the actual product at the end. Is that weird?

Well, I get it with cookies. There's a big thing about cookie dough, of course, like raw cookie dough. Yeah. hasn't quite stretched a bread yet.
Bimini Bon Boulash 21:49 Yeah, I feel like I'm quite weird. I quite like like making bread when we use like the water in the flour. I quite like just eating that raw. Is that weird?
James Acaster 22:01 I've not heard of it before.
Bimini Bon Boulash 22:02 It's not good for your stomach. But it's just I don't know what it is. I could probably survive for a bit. I'm just water and flour.
James Acaster 22:11 Do you want that as your bread course?
Bimini Bon Boulash 22:12 No white crusty roll. Let's go. It's cooked, its baked.
Ed Gamble 22:16 How about okay. Before we bring you the bread course, James as the genie waiter will bring over the dough that we're about to bake the rolls out of and you can give the dough a little taste just to make sure it's up to scratch and then we'll whisk it away and bake it for you. How does that sound?
Bimini Bon Boulash 22:31 That'd be great. And you know what? There's always off cuts of dough that gets like put in a ball of thrown away so I will happily eat that,
Ed Gamble 22:37 by all means pop into the kitchen and eat out the bin.
Bimini Bon Boulash 22:40 I'm actually starving right now and I'm trying to do this thing. This like crazy thing where you try to cut down on your bread intake and this conversation is not doing me good.
James Acaster 22:50 are you hallucinating?
Bimini Bon Boulash 22:53 I'm not hallucinating yet, but I think if we go further on, and I like I just love it and I eat it too much. There can be days where all i've eaten is bread. And I'm like, I need to eat something else because I've just literally like an entire loaf or like a whole baguette, like nothing else. Like all of my favourite foods are kind of bread based.

Off Menu ­ Ep 103: Bimini Bon Boulash
Ed Gamble 23:12 So we might see the appearance of more bread based things on the menu as we move forward then,
Bimini Bon Boulash 23:16 I think so, I was gonna try and avoid it. But ultimately, like my favourite food is pizza. So that's like it's hard to avoid when it's bread based. Yeah. It's funny, it's funny that they were like we're doing this because I remember like last summer when we were in lockdown, the first lockdown. We all sat in the garden, me and my housemates and we had this conversation from start to finish about like, because obviously we've listened to the podcast, so we all went round and was like really talking about it, and we were like really getting into it. Like you can't have that as your started, like no way.
Ed Gamble 23:48 what was the biggest controversy?
Bimini Bon Boulash 23:50 Someone said popadoms over bread. I think we were all like, really popadoms over bread? Like we were all shocked. But I mean, I would have poppadoms I feel like if I was - definitely if I was having like an Indian dish, or like something maybe with like East Asian, or like Southeast Asian, but I think ultimately bred for just everyday use. Really.
James Acaster 24:11 It's your fave and you're like em raw, no one's eating raw poppadoms.
Bimini Bon Boulash 24:16 Well, could you do that?
James Acaster 24:17 Actually, to be fair, no one besides you has eaten raw bread, to be honest.
Ed Gamble 24:23 Did you hear how excited Bimini got at even the suggestion of a raw popadom straightaway?
Bimini Bon Boulash 24:28 I kind of like, ears perked up. Yeah, I was like, Well, I'll give it a go.
James Acaster 24:35 Let's move on to your starter, the meal proper begins. What's your dream starter?
Bimini Bon Boulash 24:40 So I'm going to go with a soup but not any kind of soup because obviously it goes great with the bread. But, I will go with leek and potato soup. And it is only because it was one of the only things that my mum could cook really, really well.

Off Menu ­ Ep 103: Bimini Bon Boulash
James Acaster 24:58 And do you want it cooked by your mum?
Bimini Bon Boulash 25:00 I think so yeah cuz she got this like really good texture with it and it was like kind of really like, she'd like blend it all and it was it was it was really creamy and probably really unhealthy but I remember having it as a kid and the thing that like, it makes me remember is because my mum would always cook like when she could but I rememberI started cooking at about 14 because I was like, I want to start cooking for myself, because I don't really like this. Sorry, mum, when you listen to this, I love you. But her leek and potato soup is her standout. And I think she's lived in the Bahamas when she was younger. And all of the locals used to call it Heather soup. Her name is Heather. so they used to call it Heather soup. And because it was like the only thing that she could cook, so she would like make it for everyone and just have this like abundance of Heather soup to everyone and it was just leek and potato soup. But it's got, It's got memories. It's got nostalgia for me.
Ed Gamble 25:54 The thing is, why would you learn how to cook anything else, if you do a dish that everyone names after you?
Bimini Bon Boulash 26:00 I never exactly. And they all thought it was like the most mind blowing thing that they'd eaten and it was literally just leek and potatoes. But when my mum and dad like when they moved to the Bahamas when they were younger, I think my mum said like they literally didn't cook for like the first six months. Just ate out, which is very luxurious. They didn't buy cutlery for six months because they would just go for dinner all the time. Which I mean, I would love to do that.
Ed Gamble 26:25 I think I'd have a fork for an emergency. Yeah, if I knew I was gonna be out for six months. I definitely keep maybe one set just in case.
Bimini Bon Boulash 26:31 Yeah, I mean, the fork could have come in handy because they did get held at gunpoint once, so they could have had that fork to help them.
James Acaster 26:37 Give me all your soup.
Bimini Bon Boulash 26:41 That's what it was. They were trying to get the Heather Soup. They wanted the recipe for the leak and potatoes
Ed Gamble 26:46 But then if I if I was given the option of any of the cutlery is to protect myself against someone with a gun. I probably plump for the knife.

James Acaster 26:52 Oh yeah?
Bimini Bon Boulash 26:53 It depends tho, not butter knife, they don't do much.
James Acaster 26:56 Think it through.
Ed Gamble 26:57 All right fork then. Actually, I'd tell you what, I just get a gun and if I had to eat it soup I'd eat it with the gun.
James Acaster 27:03 Yeah. I see what your saying. And I think a gun is technically cutlery anyway.
Ed Gamble 27:07 Yeah, that's true. Yeah,
Bimini Bon Boulash 27:08 I mean, like we said earlier, sustainability, it's got to have more than one use now.
Ed Gamble 27:12 Exactly.
James Acaster 27:12 Yeah. Use the barrel as a straw?
Bimini Bon Boulash 27:15 Yeah, why not?
James Acaster 27:16 Here's my main question about Heather soup. Yeah. How much soup was your mother making? Your parents have moved to the Bahamas, and your mom has made so much soup that the locals are calling it Heather soup I think that's amazing.
Bimini Bon Boulash 27:28 She's making it for everyone.
James Acaster 27:29 She must have been having a lot of people over to have Heather soup and then going you're gonna have to eat this with your hands. We haven't got any cutlery.

Bimini Bon Boulash 27:34 Well, I remember when I was younger, going to my friend's house with my mom. And I think this is like so we're from a Scottish family and Scottish Scotland they like to meet and to veg. So yeah, my mum's only used to a certain thing but I remember her coming to, we went to my friend's mom's house and she'd made this like tomato and mozzarella salad. I remember my mother being like, Oh, this is lovely, what's in this? And she was like, mozzarella and tomatos, poor mom bless her. She's Oh, this is amazing. And she like made it. Like for her like next barbecue and she's like my salad, the Tomato mozzarella. Oh, yes. Really good. But now now I'm older. I'm like, Oh, I was just tomato mozzarella. It wasn't anything groundbreaking.
James Acaster 28:22 You got your metal straw. Yeah, you've drank your water out of it. Are you gonna pop that in the soup?
Bimini Bon Boulash 28:27 the straw?
James Acaster 28:28 Have you ever had soup through a straw?
Bimini Bon Boulash 28:31 Do you think I'm an animal? I would eat the soup with my hands. Of course I would use the straw? No, I have, no I will say I have, it depends on the bowl as well actually. Because sometimes the bowls can be too deep. You can't really give it a lick. But sometimes when the soup so good, you got to lick that bowl. Its the same with food. Me and my boyfriend, like I'll lick the bowl. I don't care. I wont do it in a restaurant, maybe. But I would do it at home.
Ed Gamble 29:00 I unfortunately do that sort of thing in restaurants all the time. And I'm roundly told off for it by my fiance on every occasion. But I know that by the time I'm halfway through licking the plate, she can't do anything about it. So I just do it. Just do it again.
Bimini Bon Boulash 29:13 Well, exactly.
Ed Gamble 29:13 It's a compliment to the chef,
James Acaster 29:15 Ac real compliment to the chef is to just lick a message into it. So I just lick "good food", So it says that and then it goes back and the chef knows what a compliment.
Ed Gamble 29:25 Yeah, once when I was eating, I was at The Breakfast Club. And a man was watching me quite intensely. And he was sat quite close to me and looking at me eat and he was looking at my food.

Bimini Bon Boulash 29:28 Was it erotic?
Ed Gamble 29:37 No, I don't think it was erotic. I think he was just fascinated by me. Not in a sexual way. I think maybe I was eating quite voraciously and it was staring at me and he wouldn't stop staring at me even though I made it quite clear that news looking at me so I made an arrow out of the bacon and wrote "idiot" in beans pointing towards him because he was looking at the plate so much so I made an error out the bacon and wrote "idiot" in the beans.
Bimini Bon Boulash 30:00 I live for that like passive aggressive pettiness.
James Acaster 30:06 Sorry Ed, Did you line up each into individual baked bean, so it said idiot? or did you write with your finger in the beans?
Ed Gamble 30:12 I tried to for a bit but then some of it was in sauce so some of it I just had sort of shape the sauce. But to be honest once it got to I-D-I , I think he knew exactly what was happening.
Bimini Bon Boulash 30:20 Well, maybe that's why he was staring. It was like, this person's making words out of beans.
Ed Gamble 30:29 The beans word was a reaction to what he was doing. So yeah, and he did look away after that. But yeah, that's the only time I've written a message in food.
Bimini Bon Boulash 30:38 Can I ask you all a question?
James Acaster 30:39 Yes, please.
Bimini Bon Boulash 30:40 Do you count how many chews of your food you do?
James Acaster 30:45 I personally do not. Edward?
Ed Gamble 30:47 I have done in the past, but only immediatly after I'm told that I should be chewing my food more, because how many is it supposed to be Bimini? There's like a rule isn't there.

Bimini Bon Boulash 30:55 28! I've tried. It's crazy. I've tried this. I'm like, because I'm a very quick eater. And I've got it from my dad. I think like growing up, they'd call me like the human dustbin because I would just literally eat, but I would I would not chew my food. And I think Yeah, sometimes I've had in the past issues with my bowels and perhaps that's why
James Acaster 31:16 well, in your defence, you were mainly eating soup growing up. So how many chews are you meant to do with that?
Bimini Bon Boulash 31:22 Exactly, is already chewed up for you?
Ed Gamble 31:26 Is that how your mom made it?
Bimini Bon Boulash 31:27 I think it's a tricky one. I do. I do want to eat slower, and enjoy my food more. But I actually think I'm eating so quickly because I am enjoying my food.
James Acaster 31:36 Yeah, well, I'm definitely like you. I eat really fast. Yeah. And sometimes I'll swallow something and think, well that wasn't ready to be swallowed.
Bimini Bon Boulash 31:48 That cut my throat.
James Acaster 31:49 Yeah, oh dear. Why did I do that? So excited for the next bite, I think exactly the same thing. I should have enjoyed that one that was alreadu in my mouth.
Ed Gamble 31:59 sometimes having to swallow a really big bit of food where you're like, you shouldn't have to go for three gulps while that's going down. I feel like an Anaconda.
Bimini Bon Boulash 32:07 I know. Yeah, I do need to be more conscious of it.
James Acaster 32:10 Well, if you want Bimini, we can set up a counter in front of you, like a digital kind of like clock that counts your chews for you as you're eating, so that you know that you've done enough chews for every every course

James Acaster 32:40 Now, we think we already know what your main course is going to be. You've told us your favourite food but we don't know the details. Are we are we looking at a trip to pizza town?
Bimini Bon Boulash 32:47 So I wasn't going to, I was gonna go with an Asian inspired dish but my heart of hearts is saying pizza. And my boyfriend is Italian. That's one of the reasons I'm with him, he can make great italian food. One of the many reasons but that does help. Pasta is something that I love to have as well. A lot of carbs. My diet is very carb heavy, I do realise that, but Stefano, he makes great Italian food. We always go for Purezza which is a restaurant in Camden, they've got one in Brighton as well. Don't know if you've heard of it. It's all vegan pizza. And it is the best pizza you will ever eat. I'm not even I'm not even like being vegan and biassed here. It won awards. It beat the Dairy and Meat awards for like pizza of the year like three years in a row. It's so good. And they make all of their own vegan cheeses in house, it's all nut based. Not all nut based. Some of it's different, and they they do like hemp bases and like they're really experimented with it and it's really really banging. They do this one in particular called Parmigiano Party, which is kind of pork. It's like vegan pork stuff. And it is just so good. It's like literally what we'll get every time we go there,
James Acaster 33:24 The parmigiana party
Bimini Bon Boulash 34:01 and the thing is that Stefano being Italian and vegan. I think like his his family were more shocked that he was vegan then he was gay. They were like, what?
Ed Gamble 34:16 He didn't hit them with that double whammy at the same time did he?.
Bimini Bon Boulash 34:19 No the same time no. I think the gay was a bit before then it was the vegan. But the Vegan was the one that they had to get most accustomed to.
Ed Gamble 34:28 Have you taken his family to Purezza, do you think they could handle that?
Bimini Bon Boulash 34:31 I think they could handle it. They haven't been to Purezza. No, I've taken my my family to Purezza and my mum. Like my granddad didn't come. I remember I remember giving my granddad a vegan burger. He's like 81 and Scottish, he's old school. And I remember giving him this vegan burger and he ate and

he was thought that was lovely, really tasty. And I was like, oh, wow, that was vegan. He was like, Oh yeah, I could tell that. You're just saying that. But yeah, my mum loved Purezza. My mom loved the pizza and she was like, she couldn't believe it was all vegan.
James Acaster 35:03 Can't believe I've never heard of this place. I really want to go there now
Bimini Bon Boulash 35:05 they also do dough balls as well.
James Acaster 35:07 I was gonna say cuz I know you love your dough, what are their dough balls like?
James Acaster 35:11 Sold
Bimini Bon Boulash 35:11 Well no, but they are cooked, but they also had this vegan cheese that oozes out of it's, it's melted like the vegan cheese they should like bottle that stuff up and sell that in supermarkets because it's the best. Like I don't swear but people go hard, like go quite nasty on vegan cheeses whereas this stuff is like otherworldly. It's literally like all made inhouse, it's just yeah, it's just so tasty. But like we go to Purezza probably once a month, like when it was open like we were going that often like they knew us by name there so. And they also do a dessert which we've never had just purely because we've always have too much bread, but it's an Oreo pizza dessert, which is more bread. We always get to the point where we outbread ourselves so we can have it.
Ed Gamble 35:11 Raw?
Ed Gamble 35:13 Whenever I see that on the menu at pizza place where they do a dessert pizza as well I think who who is getting to that point where they order a dessert pizza and obviously it's James Acaster.
James Acaster 36:05 Yeah, I'm hoping that an Oreo dessert pizza is a base then load of Oreos, then another base on top like a big Oreo.
Bimini Bon Boulash 36:14 I've not had it yet, so I can't I can't confirm or deny but I'm sure it's bangin
Ed Gamble 36:18 I was assuming it was like a black base like somehow they've got the crumb into the dough and then spread the cream the sort of creamy Oreo stuff on top. Or folded over like a calzone.

Bimini Bon Boulash 36:28 I don't think it's, yeah calzone.
James Acaster 36:31 Were you questioning the pronunciation there Bimini whether it's Calzon-e or calzone.
Bimini Bon Boulash 36:35 No I wasn't because my boyfriend's Italian and I say everything like with most London accent, so i'd be like bambino, or like parmesan o'potluck. I'm sure it's got to be said in a different Italian way. Or like yeah, Stefano as well, it's always like, Stefano, I suppose family wouldn't say like that. But like, just the London twang. I'm not coming for your pronunciation, don't worry. He's very good at it. And like he's lived here since 2011. I must say his grammar sometimes is probably better than mine. And it's his second language. And I'm like, he pulls me up and stuff and I'm like excuse me. I'm not gonna pull you up and you're Italian. Because I don't know it. He's very smart. So I respect that but like Yeah, he doesn't try and do my accent .
James Acaster 37:23 You glancing over at the specials board whenever you go into this pizza place. I think that that's the most that I look at specials boards. I'm quite excited when going to pizza places about the specials board. I'd say anywhere else. I'm mainly ordering off the menu. Wherever I go to pizza place I'm probably most likely to go for a special
Bimini Bon Boulash 37:40 that's interesting. No, they do have cool special like cocktails and special pizzas. Theres pizza the month which we will get sometimes actually we'll get one from the specials board, But a lot of times it's well, because it is a piece of place, they do do other stuff over the pizza. Like pastas and things which I love as well. But I do think if you go to a pizza place get bloody pizza.
James Acaster 37:58 Got to get the pizza. Anyone who orders pastor at a pizza place winds me up so much. I'm not joking. I get so wound up. Sometimes you say to people, theres this great pizza place. You've got to come and have a pizza there and you bring them in and then they look at the menu and go, I'll just have a spaghetti bolognese and I think Wow, so nice friendship while it lasted.
Ed Gamble 38:16 It's so rude. This feels like a massive subtweet on me James from when we went to Roberta's in New York and I got the cacio e pepe.
James Acaster 38:23 Well, we all got that because Todd Barrt had chosen it on his dream menu and we all wanted to have it.

Bimini Bon Boulash 39:32 Now I happen actually. But I do, when I make pasta I put potato in pasta, which some people find quite controversial but I think that's a trick that people are missing. Honestly like pasta with potato in, anything with pesto base is just carb carb. It's just brilliant.
Ed Gamble 39:50 What sort of potatoes you putting in? Are you like chopping up boiled potatoes, roast potatoes. What's going in there,

I would say the thing that's really going to stress a bit a pasta out is if it's bubbling away in the pot, and then a potato comes in for a swim.
Bimini Bon Boulash 39:55 Maris Piper will get Maris Piper cut them up, boil them with the pasta But you boil the potatoes first for a bit and then add the pasta. Make sure it's in a big pan plenty of water. So the pastor doesn't get stressed. Because Stefano says that is a thing and he is Italian, so I respect that. And then you make you make your sauce and your base wherever it is. And it's just great. His people now have pasta with potato and I'm pretty sure we invented it. Maybe we didn't.
Bimini Bon Boulash 40:29 Well, no, because the potato is already in there, so actually the pasta stressing out the potato. The potato needs longer time than the pasta. But you do need a big pan, because I've cooked many pasta in my time where the pan has been too small. And Stefano gets very angry at me for stressing out the pasta.
Ed Gamble 40:47 stressing out the pasta.
James Acaster 40:48 How would Stepheno I feel about this? I got an arancini the other day, a big old and arancini ball. I've got a -
Ed Gamble 40:55 How big?
James Acaster 40:56 It was about a cricket ball size. And there's lots of different ones, and I asked the spaghetti carbonara one and I bit into it. And it just was rolled up spaghetti carbonara that covered in breadcrumbs. So I bit into it and it just blossomed and it was just all spaghetti carbonara inside
Ed Gamble 41:08 like long strands of spaghetti?
James Acaster 41:13 Just a full spaghetti carbonara in a ball. It was delicious.
Bimini Bon Boulash 41:16 Oh my god. Well, I bet that sounds delicious. But that doesn't sound like what you wanted.
James Acaster 41:21 Well, it was what I didn't know I wanted.

Okay, well, that's always good. Sometimes the universe answers as in many ways, and maybe that was what the universe was giving you that day.
James Acaster 41:31 Yeah, I think so. I don't know if Stefano would approve of it.
Bimini Bon Boulash 41:35 I'll ask Stefano. I think sometimes people do try to be experimental with the Italian cuisine. And I do think it's, it's so successful, and so delicious, for a reason that you don't have to try to make it something that isn't.
Ed Gamble 41:50 The supermarket Iceland, they famously do Chicken Tikka lasagna.
Bimini Bon Boulash 41:54 God No. I just think sometimes you just gotta leave it.
Ed Gamble 42:03 I think that's the line, isn't it? Just leave it Iceland.
James Acaster 42:13 We come to your side dish.
Bimini Bon Boulash 42:14 Let's go with Cajun - Oh my god I'm about to contradict myself again.
James Acaster 42:23 Cajun lasagna?
Bimini Bon Boulash 42:24 Cajun salted fries. That's not too bad, thats not too far is it, that that's not to like chicken tikka lasagna. That's just Cajun salted fries. So good. But cooked to perfection really crunchy.
Ed Gamble 42:39 Tell me Bimini, because the the involvement of Cajun spicing in fries now makes me think what shape are these fries? Are we curling them up?
Bimini Bon Boulash 42:47 I'm trying to think if I want anything else on them. I want them to be quite bitty. Gotta be crispy. I think they've got to be - Do you know what they are? They're they're just a bit smaller than your average chip shop chip, but they're cooked crunchier. There's actually a chipshop, beacuase I was just in margate, so this is just fresh in my memory. They have a chip shop there, which was really tasty and they they've got it right. But that kind of level of chip that's cooked soft in the middle but really crispy on the outside.

Not burned tho. It's not chard, you want it to be like just cooked just before charing, shareing, charing, is it charing?
James Acaster 42:47 I'm so charing, personally, but you can say shareing.
Ed Gamble 43:20 Shareing is lovely.
James Acaster 43:25 And shareing sounds nicer actually.
Bimini Bon Boulash 43:27 Yeah, okay, let's change that in the dictionary. But yeah. Just before it's not burnt, and then it's covered in Cajun salted and just super delicious. And I do think you do need a side of garlic vegan mayo just to dip in or sriracha as well to add a bit more spice because I do like spice.
James Acaster 43:47 We'll give you two dips.
Bimini Bon Boulash 43:48 Okay, that's lovely. Thank you.
Ed Gamble 43:50 I would say vegan garlic Mayo is one of the things that is absolutely indistinguishable from non vegan. If you get a vegan garlic Mayo is exactly the same as a non vegan garlic mayo. It's absolutely delicious.
Bimini Bon Boulash 44:03 Well, Mayo has really stepped it up over the last couple of years. I went vegan in 2015. And that was fuck all really to eat, and so that's, I guess where the love of bread came from. But it's evolved over the years, which I'm very grateful for and we now have our own section in supermarkets. progression is happening. People are noticing us. There's a bit more respect, not a lot but a bit. Progression with the mayo. I'm here for that.
James Acaster 44:30 There is one person who can tell the difference between vegan garlic mayo and normal garlic mayo, and that is your grandfather.
Ed Gamble 44:40 Only if you told him afterwards though,
Bimini Bon Boulash 44:41 only if you told him afterwards. Exactly this is the thing I like to try. it's not like spiking my family, I don't spike them. But one of my pet peeves about cooking or making food for people that are non vegan that

my friends, is that they say the phrase, "this is good for vegan" and I'm like, NO, Its just good, that's not good for Vegan. It's just good food. It really it really grinds my gears at one.
James Acaster 45:07 That'd be a good TV show. Just called good for vegan as someone hosts it, and people don't know if the food is vegan or not. They have to eat it and say what they think and make the guess.
Bimini Bon Boulash 45:20 You've just come up with channel fours new reality competition show. Yeah.
James Acaster 45:27 I think you'd be a good host for it Bimini.
Ed Gamble 45:29 Yeah, you'd be great at that Bimini.
Bimini Bon Boulash 45:30 Well let's do it, I think you need to pitch it, because that's actually a really good idea. And I feel like people are gonna listen to his podcast and then jump on it. So I think you need to get in there quickly.
James Acaster 45:39 Yeah, that's a few ideas we come up with on this podcast, actually, that I think we need to get in there quickly and do this, and Benito stops us from doing it. And then I know other people are gonna make a lot of money from it.
Ed Gamble 45:49 What other ideas are there, James, that we've come up with on this podcast?
James Acaster 45:53 We've come up with loads of ideas, haven't we? Laying on a conveyor belt and going through the glaze curtain at a donut shop?
Ed Gamble 46:00 Yeah. Is that something that you'd be interested in Bimini if we make a show where we lay down celebrities on a conveyor belt and put them through a glaze curtain at a donut shop, if it was vegan glaze?
Bimini Bon Boulash 46:08 if it was vegan glaze, and also I got creative control over the outfit. Yeah. And also as it goes back round, somehow I'm in a new look, every time it goes round. It just keeps going. Like it's just a different look, it's like an actual concept. It's like an art show. It's like a fashion show. It's like a Mugler fashion show but in a glaze kitchen. Brilliant. There we go. Art, fashion, food.

you have actually just refined that idea to something good. Thank you Bimini.
James Acaster 46:40 Your drink. What's your dream drink for this meal?
Bimini Bon Boulash 46:43 I am going to go with a chilli salted Margarita.
Ed Gamble 46:48 A pecante, would we call it a pecante? Have you heard it called that before?
Bimini Bon Boulash 46:52 I have not. But I have had it called Margarita with chilli and salt all around that rim. Rim, rim, rim. But we can call it pecante, is that what its called?
Ed Gamble 47:02 Yours describes it way better. Yours is a tomato mozzarella salad style thing. I know exactly what it is now. I've just had it called pecante before with a half a chilli stuck in the top of it as well.
Bimini Bon Boulash 47:12 Oh, okay. Okay, that could be cool, I think it's got to be frozen though.
James Acaster 47:16 Yes,
Bimini Bon Boulash 47:17 Margaret is frozen.
Ed Gamble 47:18 Oh, okay. Yeah, now we're talking.
James Acaster 47:20 I introduced my mum to frozen Margaritas recently. She'd never had them before. I made sure she ordered one, changed her life.
Bimini Bon Boulash 47:26 Was she hyper?
James Acaster 47:28 She was saying how delicious it was all the time. Kept on remarking on how delicious it was.
Bimini Bon Boulash 47:33 They are really good as a cocktail. It's a really great blend of lime. See, lime. The edginess of the lime. The tequila, tequila being like that like the only alcoholic drink thats an upper which I think is important

sometimes if you don't want to go on a downward spiral with gin which I've done many times. And so I think I think Margarita is the way forward.
James Acaster 47:55 Talk about your journey to this particular type of Margarita.Whatever Margaritas did you visit along the way that weren't quite as good but that led us to this point.
Bimini Bon Boulash 48:06 So we, me and my housemates, we do love a margarita and it reminds me of our summer lockdown last year. When we were locked down together we had a garden.We moved house recently and we don't have a garden as much anymore but we have this lovely gardens, it was really sunny and we will have that Margaritas in the evenings and it reminds me of that time and I think we experimented quite a lot. I would say some margaritas were terrible and offensive to the entire culture that it comes from. But other margaritas were spot on and banging. Sometimes we've done it where we've been having drinks and the ladle comes out. So this is another multi use purpose. We don't have shot glasses, we use a ladle. So we will do shots tequila out of a ladle. My housemate, when she gets the ladle out, you know, it's about to get real. That's when it's about to go down. But before the ladle comes out, we're usually a bit more kind of PC or a bit more reserved to just have the lovely margaritas but I'm always up for experimenting, as long as it's vegan, if someone says to me try this I'll never say no
James Acaster 49:11 Can you remember the first time you had this particular Margarita with the chilli?
Bimini Bon Boulash 49:14 probably was only a cup about a year or so ago I think I was introduced with a chilli and actually I think it's the reason I got into Margaritas, because before that I was always a gin and tonic drinker. The reason I got to Margarita is because I'm a big fan of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and they all drink margaritas on there, and they look so glam and they're always just like getting really wasted. And I remember being like, Oh they all drink margaritas, I want to start drinking margaritas, and then I got onto Margaritas is and was like, no wonder they drink Margaritas it's brilliant. And from then on, I am a margarita stan account.
Ed Gamble 49:47 Obviously, on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills they all drink margaritas and then absolutely scream horrible things at each other. Is that something that you look forward to of an evening?
Bimini Bon Boulash 49:54 We don't scream at each other. But like, even when I was filming the drag race reality show I didn't scream at anyone, but they do do that. And it's very entertaining to watch.
James Acaster 50:04 I haven't seen the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Do they have a ladle? do they drink out of a ladle?

No, they're all rich. So they don't have ladles, they have actual shot glasses. But they are missing a trick, cause the thing with the ladle, you've seen how deep a ladle can be? You don't know how big that shot is going to be? Yeah, you just neck it back and then you're either passed out, or you've got a bit more go in ya. But the ladles deceiving.
Ed Gamble 50:29 In this dream meal, would you like us to serve Heather soup with the ladle for your starter and then bring it out at the end of the meal to do shots out of?
Bimini Bon Boulash 50:37 Absolutely, but I need my housemate Ella to come out with me and she has to give me the ladle because it is her ritual to get the ladle out.
James Acaster 50:44 Great, every time someone mentions a ladle. I just always think of that episode of friends where they say See you ladle. Remember that?
Bimini Bon Boulash 50:54 I'm afraid I don't
James Acaster 50:56 Theres, an episode of friends where there's a guest character who's quite funny, I can't remember what they're called. And Phoebe says, Oh, you know, if if that person had come in and wanted a ladle, they'd say, see ya ladle. And it stuck with me forever. really stuck with me forever. Always think about it. Can't hear the word ladle without thinking. See you ladle.
Bimini Bon Boulash 51:20 Well, I guess that you could say that's where your comedy stems from, that joke? Yeah. Phoebe from friends,
James Acaster 51:26 Phoebe is saying what joke another person would possibly make. That is my entire comedy persona.
Ed Gamble 51:32 And now it's starting to make sense why you end all of your sets with, see you ladle everyone.
James Acaster 51:36 Yeah, see you ladle. Never gets anything. And then I walk out. Go back into the dressing room, head in my hands. Oh no, it bombed again. I can't believe it.
James Acaster 51:48 Look, I've kind of been putting off the desert a bit and trying to like bring up other subjects. Because earlier you said that sometimes you go to the pizza place and you don't have dessert. And that that made me quite trepidatious and I'm feeling quite trepidatious right now.

Bimini Bon Boulash 52:03 Oh my goodness. I never said that. No, I never said that. You twisted my words. I said I don't have the oreo pizza dessert, because I've had too much bread, but I certainly have room for dessert every time I eat.
Ed Gamble 52:14 So relieved, aren't you james?
James Acaster 52:16 Ah, let's do this then Bimini, the dream dessert.
Bimini Bon Boulash 52:18 I would say I love savoury, savoury most, but I do have a sweet tooth. There's always a bit of room for dessert.
James Acaster 52:25 Well as long as there's room I'm happy
Ed Gamble 52:27 but what I say Bimini is if you don't if you don't want to have a dessert, this dream meal you don't have to you can pick something savoury in place of the dessert,
James Acaster 52:34 Oh herer we go. Devil on your shoulder.
Bimini Bon Boulash 52:36 I'm going to go with the dessert, something sweet because we've been very heavy on the bread and the savoury and I do love savoury and but we've had a lot of really banging savoury food so I do have room for dessert. And I will say that the particular dessert that I am going to go with is - it's a toss up, drumroll please - it is either strawberry cheesecake or Sticky Toffee puddin. One of those two served with a dollop of ice cream for the strawberry cheesecake or vegan custard for the sticky toffee pudding. Warm for the sticky toffee pudding cold for the cheesecake.
James Acaster 53:18 I'm happy to go double dessert here. But I guess we should probably try and make you choose.
Ed Gamble 53:22 Let's talk about both and then me and James can decide whether we're going to make you choose one of them if you clearly are in favour of one of them more, or whether we go double dessert.
Bimini Bon Boulash 53:30 They both represent me. They both represent both sides to my personality. I've got the sweet bit of kind of pink very like sexy side or I've got the sticky toffee bit more gritty, bit more punky side. I just feel like

they both represent me. And it would be a shame to choose. But I feel like if you were to make me choose, I would have to probably say sticky toffee pudding.
Ed Gamble 53:58 Well now I was with you with the sort of, two sides of your personality. I was like I like where Bimini is going with this. This sort of sexy strawberry cheesecake side I was with you there. It's when you describe sticky toffee pudding as punk but I got a slightly lost how a sticky toffee pudding punk.
Bimini Bon Boulash 54:13 Well, I feel like sticky toffee pudding. I just think it just it just doesn't really it doesn't really know what it's up to. But it defies. it's sticky.
Ed Gamble 54:23 Yes,
Bimini Bon Boulash 54:23 but it's sweet as well. And it's it's it's - Is it a pudding?
Ed Gamble 54:29 Yeah,
Bimini Bon Boulash 54:29 I don't know. does it know if it's a puddin? It is a pudding. Okay, well, okay, maybe I was just I was clutching metallic straws there. But I think its punk.
Ed Gamble 54:41 I loved hearing you tie yourself up in knots there. Just going, Is it a puddin? And then everyone clearly just going? Yeah, it is a pudding. We'll know it's a pudding, Its famously one of the most famous puddings. Sticky toffee pudding.
James Acaster 54:53 It's in the name
Bimini Bon Boulash 54:55 I was like, i'm out of my depth now, I'm not gonna bullshit you. You know what you're talking about.
James Acaster 55:02 I think you get sticky toffee pudding at a school dinner don't ya? Yeah, and stuff like that. That's punk.

Bimini Bon Boulash 55:12 I think so.
Ed Gamble 55:13 But I will see sticky toffee pudding more as like a very traditional sort of almost Victorian British desert that you do in like a gentlemen's club or something.
James Acaster 55:22 steampunks, if it's Victorian
Ed Gamble 55:25 and its a steamed pudding
James Acaster 55:26 Yeah. And it's steamed. So there you go.
Bimini Bon Boulash 55:27 I would say that I've been to many a gentlemen's club. And I've never eaten sticky toffee pudding.
Ed Gamble 55:32 I didn't mean necessarily that sort of gentlemen's club.
Bimini Bon Boulash 55:38 But maybe a lot more classy, well because no. I mean, I'm all for it. Like a lot of my performance styles are heavily inspired by kind of the stripper and burlesque scene. So I love a gentlemen's club. I'm all for that. I'm pro pro that. Very much so.
Ed Gamble 55:55 Oh, see, I was imagining like the sort of dark wood like traditional gentlemen's club, you'd see like old politicians in there or something.
Bimini Bon Boulash 56:02 I'm now picturing, like Hugh Hefner is kind of gentlemen's club where there's all the politicians cheating on their wives with playboy bunnies.
Ed Gamble 56:10 Yeah, and what are they eating? Sticky toffee pudding.

So your entire menu menu, Bimini, is served at the Playboy Mansion now. And that's your dream restaurant meal becomes playboy mansions menu.
Bimini Bon Boulash 56:26 Well, I just feel like this is a full circle moment for me because, Pamela Anderson is someone who I've heavily looked to for inspiration because she's someone that has been very overtly feminine and proud of that femininity, but also uses her platform to advocate for social injustices. And she was in the Playboy Mansion. Now I'm in the Playboy Mansion doing the same thing. Me and Pamela Anderson full circle moment. Here we go brought it back to Pammy. And that is why Lewis Hamilton is at number one, because I'm not on a racetrack eating my dinner. I'm at the Playboy Mansion and a lot more fun. Pamela Anderson is the original babe. Yeah, she was a 90s bombshell love Pammy
James Acaster 57:08 In my life, the first person that other kids at school told me was sexy.
Ed Gamble 57:12 Yeah, same.
James Acaster 57:13 And was a babe, was Pamela Anderson. So for my whole life just because, you know, I was born 1985 so the age I was when the other kids in my class started talking about people being sexy and people being babes. Pamela Anderson was one that everyone was talkin about. So for the rest of my life whenever anyone mentions babes, i'll always think, original babe, Pamela Anderson.
Bimini Bon Boulash 57:36 Oh gee, babe, totally.
Ed Gamble 57:37 And because of barbed wire, the film that she was in, and the catchphrase of that film was "Don't call me babe".
Bimini Bon Boulash 57:43 don't don't call me babe.
Ed Gamble 57:44 So if anything, you should stop now because she did ask you to stop calling her babe in that film.
James Acaster 57:48 Uh oh. Oh no, oh no.
Bimini Bon Boulash 57:52 Also, I think for me, similar experience, but maybe different is that I knew I was gay. Because I wanted to be Pamela Anderson. I didn't fancy Pamela Anderson. So I remember thinking, Okay, well, these

feelings are maybe not normal. And then I grew up and became a drag artist and used Pamela has a lot of sources of inspiration. So there we go full circle again.
James Acaster 58:16 I think that would have been more fun than my experience. My experience was just just all the other kids telling me the Pamela Anderson was a babe and was sexy and then I just agreed with them all because I didn't really know what was going on. That was it.
Ed Gamble 58:28 And when they released that - do you remember they released the virgin cola Pammy bottles that were supposed to be in the shape of Pamela Anderson. And I went out and bought one of those and I thought the bottle was sexy. And that's how I realised I was straight and disgusting.
Bimini Bon Boulash 58:42 I love that. But I mean, I wonder if that would I wonder if that would fly today?
Ed Gamble 58:50 I'm not sure it would.
Bimini Bon Boulash 58:51 I feel like the bottles would not be modelled after curvaceous women anymore.
James Acaster 58:55 No, it's absolutely mad. And then you bought one as well, you little perve.
Ed Gamble 59:00 Yeah, me and my friend went to the petrol station to buy one because we'd heard they were releasing bottles in the shape of Pamela Anderson. I think we were hoping for like actual tits on the bottle rather than just the shape of it, but absolutely disgusting little boys.
Bimini Bon Boulash 59:12 Well, I think the fact that you fancied a bottle is quite the um - maybe it links, maybe Freud would go crazy over this.
James Acaster 59:19 Yes. You said that's how you knew you were straight. But that's let's be very clear. You fancied a bottle.
Bimini Bon Boulash 59:28 That's just admitted the theory that sexuality is fluid.

James Acaster 1:02:16 Simon a Rogan and the lads Brigade, sent us some berkswell put in which is my dream side dish. And let me tell you, when you get sent your dream side dish to make at home, you get a bit worried. You think I've said this was my dream side? I've gone on the podcast.
Ed Gamble 1:02:32 On record
James Acaster 1:02:33 On record, I've said it maybe it will turn out it's not my dream side and I'll leave it and go oh actually, I don't like this as much. Oh man. I've been in heaven Ed,
Ed Gamble 1:02:42 Oh man. Me too.
James Acaster 1:02:43 Just absolutely delicious. I was saying to you, I had my first hang over the year the other day. I didn't drink for the first three months of the year, April. tiptoeing back into drinking again, having a nice time. First proper getting drunk at the end of April. And that hangover, I ate six berkswell puddings and I was like hangovers great actually. I've really wasted the first three months of this year.
Ed Gamble 1:03:06 Well, I wasn't hungover and I ate four, so God knows what's going to happen if I have a hangover. It's gonna be absolutely awful. The Berkswell pudding are just the most, some of the most delicious things I've ever eaten. Oh, so thanks to Simon Rogen and Tom Barnes and Ollie Marlo, all at Simon Rogen At Home. Thank you.
James Acaster 1:03:22 Ed got sent a wheel of the cheese.
Ed Gamble 1:03:24 The Berkswell lads sent me a wheel of the cheese, James. And I'm talking a huge wheel. Not like you could put on a carm but you could put it on a child's trike, the front wheel of a child's trike

if you wanted that child to grow up to be a horrible cheese and biscuits loving freak.
Ed Gamble 1:03:40 Well thank you to the Berkswell, we don't think you're freaks actually, we think you're great. So thanks for sending that, which means I'm always gonna have cheese to go on my berkswell puddings Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. Also, James I don't know if you remember, one of my dream dishes was the Berber and Q cauliflower. The whole roast cauliflower with tahini and rose petals and pine nuts and all sorts of things like that. And they sent me one. They sent me one they do a meal kit of it. And it comes with hummus as well, and pitas and I had an absolute party by myself
James Acaster 1:04:12 Ed's favourite kind of party, self party. Yeah, not a parmigiana party. An Ed self party. Also, I shouted out some poppadoms from Namaste Katmandu and they're given me free food for life. A wonderful curry house in Edinburgh.
Ed Gamble 1:04:31 And in some other news. James is moving to Edinburgh.
James Acaster 1:04:34 I'm going to be moving to Edinburgh very quickly and never buying food again.
Ed Gamble 1:04:38 I can't wait. Thank you to the good people at Fallow who sent us some amazing burger kits, including these things called corn ribs, where you chop up corn on the cob and deep fry it and then put this incredible kombu seasoning on the top. Let me tell you they said extra kombu seasoning. James has made corn ribs four times by himself since then,
James Acaster 1:04:56 yeah, I keep on buying corn on the cobs cut them into quarters Making corn ribs at home. I love it. And big squeeze of lime on every single corn rib. Bimini would love it in the evening.
Ed Gamble 1:05:07 And Alls Well sent us their gin and bacon meal kit, which was fantastic. There was this pork collar in there. There's slow cooked pork collar and bacon jam that was just so good.
James Acaster 1:05:19 And of course, I loved the gin and tonic dessert.
Ed Gamble 1:05:23 The gin and tonic cheesecake, but thank you very much for all that delicious food. I have genuinely never eaten so much.

Off Menu ­ Ep 103: Bimini Bon Boulash
Yeah, Dee licious. Thank you so much. And Ed, may I say, after all that food I ate. I was bready, cheady and ready for beddy. Have I used that right?
Ed Gamble 1:05:40 we should also say that Bimini was a bit annoyed at the end because she was gonna say see you ladle. She'd been planning it for like the whole time since James said See you ladle. And then Benito ended the recording so
James Acaster 1:05:53 yep, from inside his little cupboard locked in there. Little vegetarian cupboard, eating his yogurt. And he just stopped it short, he managed to get his revenge somehow little spiteful vegetarian, not liking vegans, stopped it really early. But Bimini would have said See you ladle. And it would have been the perfect end to the episode.
Ed Gamble 1:06:10 It would have been the perfect end to the episode, so sorry, Bimini and sorry listeners. Anyway, bye.
James Acaster 1:06:15 Bye.
