Ed Gamble 00:13 Welcome to the most delicious podcast on the internet - Off Menu with Ed Gamble and James a caster, but beware don't eat the liver. It's deadly poisonous. Hello, James.
James Acaster 00:23 Wow, I did not see that twist coming in the intro, very scary. People who have never listened to this podcast before are now going to be quite scared. They're gonna think it's a horror podcast, but it's not a horror podcast.
Ed Gamble 00:33 It's not a horror podcast, although we could we should do a horror podcast me and you.
James Acaster 00:37 Yeah, I think we could do quite a good one, goth-menu.
Ed Gamble 00:39 goth-menu. Yeah.
James Acaster 00:43 Good. I'm trying to think of things to add to it. I don't feel can improve on that.
Ed Gamble 00:46 Yeah, let's just leave it where it is. It's perfect joke from a perfect guy. But this is not a horror podcast. It is a food podcast James.
James Acaster 00:54 we invite a guest into the dream restaurant every week and we ask them their favourite ever; starter main course dessert side dish and drink not in that order. And this week, our special guest is Rafe Spall,
Ed Gamble 01:07 Rafe Spall, a brilliant actor, an actor of much repute, James, he's done so much brilliant stuff.
James Acaster 01:14 We love Rafe Spall, so do you. That's why you're listening to this podcast. It's very exciting to have Rafe Spall on the podcast, but what food will he choose? And will he choose the secret ingredient which will mean that even though he's Rafe Spall, we will kick him out of the dream restaurant?
Ed Gamble 01:29 And this week's secret ingredient is, Dandelion and Burdock.

James Acaster 01:32 Dandelion and Burdock.
Ed Gamble 01:34 what is it? What is that drink?
James Acaster 01:36 I don't like it
Ed Gamble 01:37 no, me neither. I think I've only tasted it once. Maybe.
James Acaster 01:40 Yeah, I know what a dandelion is, still not clear on what a burdock is. Yeah, don't think that a drink should be made out of them.
Ed Gamble 01:47 No, sir. No, sir. Thank you very much. It's quite an old school drink isn't it? It's something you might hear about like your granddad might go. Well, I remember when I was a little boy. I had my little shorts on running over from school for me cold dandelion and burdock.
James Acaster 02:01 Yeah. That was a very good impression of a grandad. Yeah. You hear those stories and it doesn't make you go, I wish I was a kid when granddad was a kid, that sounds horrible. It just sounds like they've gone to a field or like a garden that's overgrown and just pulled up all the weeds and all the different stuff, put it in a sieve and strained it and then shook it up a bit and gone. This is a fizzy drink, this'll do.
Ed Gamble 02:25 Oh, it was such a treat back in my day, dandelion and burdock. It was a perfect little drink to have with you boiled stomach.
James Acaster 02:31 I like this character. Whats the character called?
Ed Gamble 02:35 Granddad Ed.
James Acaster 02:36 Granddad Ed.
Ed Gamble 02:37 Yeah.

James Acaster 02:38 Grandad Ed. Would you like to eat, Granddad Ed?
Ed Gamble 02:41 Well, of course the boiled stomachs very nice. Mashed swede
James Acaster 02:45 Got boiled sweets?
Ed Gamble 02:46 I love boiled sweets, I'm always sucking on a boiled sweet. Well, I've tried to hide them but I found them again. They're in the VHS cases.
James Acaster 02:55 Oh very very sneaky wife.
Ed Gamble 02:57 Sneaky wife.
James Acaster 02:58 So if Rafe Spall says dandelion and burdock. We will kick him out but we welcome in granddad Ed to the resturant.
Ed Gamble 03:04 Yes, graddad Ed, will be there instead doing his dream menu. I think we all know what desserts gonna be.
James Acaster 03:09 Yeah,
Ed Gamble 03:10 But hopefully Rafe Spall will not to be kicked out of the dream restaurant I because hopefully he'll be trying his best which is a coincidence because trying is the name of his sitcom which is on Apple TV plus. Its a second season and it's streaming from the 14th of May. You can get the first season now.
James Acaster 03:26 Yes fantastic. Very exciting stuff and add that was such a good link into that. Really, really you're on you're on your game today you're A-game.
Ed Gamble 03:36 Well lets hope that form maintains itself when we hear the off menu menu of Rafe Spall.

Welcome Rafe Spall to the dream restaurant.
Rafe Spall 03:54 Look out.
James Acaster 03:55 Welcome Rafe Spall to the dream resturant.We've been expected for some time.
Rafe Spall 03:59 well I'm so pleased to be here.
Ed Gamble 04:00 It's it's very nice to have you here, Rafe. apologies for my internet cutting out there at that that inopportune moment. That's like being welcomed to a restaurant and they immediately slam the door in your face. As soon as you get to the porch. So apologies.
James Acaster 04:14 You ever been refused entry? You ever been refused entry to a restaurant or cafe or an establishment Rafe?
Rafe Spall 04:20 Yeah, you know, this sounds apocryphal. But you know that thing where you get turned down from a nightclub because you've got trainers on and then you put your socks over your trainers?
James Acaster 04:30 No,
Ed Gamble 04:31 Yeah
Rafe Spall 04:31 I've done that before.
James Acaster 04:33 No, i've never heard of that before.
Rafe Spall 04:35 Because there used to be a thing because because I came of sort of, like my teens. I grew up in southeast London in the 90s. And at that time, UK garage was a big thing. Right? Yeah. And especially on the Old Kent road. That was the sort of, the beating heart of the UK garage scene, right? And garage, their whole thing was like sexy and stylish, right? You had to come looking nice. Yeah. So a lot of the things would be like, no caps, no trainers, no attitude, right? Those were the three things about not getting into a club. And sometimes, well, one time, I didn't actually do it. So I'm using some licence here. A friend of mine turned up with trainers on and probably a little bit of attitude. And we, and we

were turned away. And then someone said, just take your black socks off, put them over your trainers. And he did. And we sailed on into Cookies and Cream garage night.
Ed Gamble 05:34 cookies and cream. Wow.
James Acaster 05:36 Food related, immediatly.
Rafe Spall 05:38 See, that story did come round
James Acaster 05:41 you knew what you were doing
Ed Gamble 05:42 Were the bouncers letting that slide? Did they know the sock trick? Or were they just not looking properly and they thought,
Rafe Spall 05:48 They just thought you had big shoes on.
James Acaster 05:51 Big wooly shoes
Rafe Spall 05:54 Exactly. big fluffy shoes. He thought none the wiser, he thought he'd gone home and got changed into some respectable shoes. Alas, no, it was a ruse.
James Acaster 06:04 If someone was to make a film about the 90s, UK garage scene. I mean, we already know you definitely want to be in it.
Rafe Spall 06:12 I do
James Acaster 06:13 It's your upbringing, it's where you come from, but like, who would you want to play in that film? If you look back at the garage scene, all the big names in it, or the big players, who would you want to play?
Rafe Spall 06:22 Well, two local celebrities, where I grew up. were two MCs called Nikki S and Nike. Oh, yeah. And I remember once, I was really, I was in this place called the Paradise Bar and Brockley and Nikki S had just done a storming set. People were really sort of in awe of him. And he came walking towards me

and he made eye contact with me and he put his fist up to fist bump me. Yeah. And I put my fist up. I fought he knows who I am, and he sailed straight past me and fist bumped someone behind me.
Ed Gamble 06:53 Oh, no,
Ed Gamble 06:54 I would say Nikki S gets his fist bumps ready too early. In that case? And that is not your fault.
Rafe Spall 06:59 Exactly, but but there's sort of UK garage voice. I don't know if you, maybe you don't, if you weren't that sort of ofay with UK garage radio in the 90's, it was that sort of like ladies crew bubbling fresh. You know that sort of like, shout out to all the ladies in the venue. It's gonna be a road block event. It was like no one has ever spoken like that. And I don't know why. I don't know how they settled on that voice as the voice to get people jazzed up about the garriage night.
Ed Gamble 07:31 Who was the first guy to do that voice and at what point did everyone go? Yeah, well, we're gonna stick with it.
Rafe Spall 07:37 Yeah, listen, we should probably do a, we should probably do an advert for for this club night. How do you even sound on an advert? Lady is and let me tell you. It's gonna be a bangin night.
Ed Gamble 07:50 What is what is bubbling, bubbling fresh mean? Cos I've heard people say that before.
Rafe Spall 07:54 well, bubbling is dancing. And fresh is real fresh dancing.
Ed Gamble 08:00 Yeah
James Acaster 08:00 I see. Speaking of voices, I didn't know what you really sounded like rife until just now?
Rafe Spall 08:05 Are you surprised?
James Acaster 08:06 Yeah, I've seen you. I've seen you in a lot of films a lot of TV. And I think I've only heard you speak like this and Shaun of the Dead. I don't think I've heard you use this voice anywhere else.

I'm just, I'm literally putting it on now. This is not how I speak. I speak like that garage voice, that's how I that's how I usually talk. How was your day at school?
James Acaster 08:27 is that to your kids? Is that how you talk to them?
Rafe Spall 08:29 What are you thinkin for dinner?
Ed Gamble 08:33 Ladies.
Rafe Spall 08:35 This is how I sound? Yeah.
James Acaster 08:36 Have you always been good at voices because I'm obsessed with people who are good at voices I can't do any voices except my own. I can't do accents. Anyone who can, I think is amazing. And don't feel pressured Rafe into doing your repertoire or anything because he always does this when we have actors on he gets all excited.
Rafe Spall 08:51 James, if someone said to you, you will die if you don't do one accent and you could and you could back yourself to do one, what would the what would the one be that you would back yourself to do?
James Acaster 09:01 Oh God,
Ed Gamble 09:02 can you have a go the UK garage voice
James Acaster 09:04 Bubblin fresh, Ladies. Ladies. Bubbling fresh.
Rafe Spall 09:10 That sounds more like thieves do not operate at this fairground. Thats more like that.
James Acaster 09:15 Yeah, yeah,
Ed Gamble 09:16 It did sound like James Acaster garage Club night. There's always a hint of Acaster in everything that you do, I think.

Rafe Spall 09:22 James Where did you grow up? Where's your accent from
James Acaster 09:24 Kettering, Northamptonshire, Kettering
Rafe Spall 09:26 I did a play set in Northamptonshire once and someone tried,
James Acaster 09:30 Kinky Boots?
Rafe Spall 09:31 No it was not Kinky Boots, alas. It was a play at the Royal Court called Alaska. But they tried to get us to do Northampton accents and it's almost impossible because it's so like, nothing. Do you know what I mean, but it's got a bit of that, it gets towards sort of East Anglian or something weird like, do you know what I mean. It's quite difficult to get to get your head round.
James Acaster 09:54 It's a pick-n-mix of everywhere else which is why it's so mad. I can't do other answers because we take all the lazy parts of everyone else's accent. And we do all of them in one voice. So I don't really pronounce my T-H' s, I drop a lot of my G's and my T's say AR sounds on the side of my mouth like a farmer, do all that stuff. But I can't adapt to other regions.
Ed Gamble 10:15 You are like a farmer actually.
James Acaster 10:17 I am like a farmer. When I started out in stand up, some comedians used to make fun of the way I said Mars Bars, I said it out the side of my mouth.
Rafe Spall 10:23 Mars bar. Ed, how's your accent?
Ed Gamble 10:26 I'm not sure. They're probably fine. They're better than James's.
James Acaster 10:29 Ed's good, do Edwin Coffee.
Ed Gamble 10:31 Oh, no, that's terrible. Because my American accent is quite poor. I'd say I can do cartoonish versions of some British accents

Rafe Spall 10:38 Go on then. It is a tough one. probably the toughest, Northeastern
Ed Gamble 10:41 I could do that in a cartoonish way, man.
Rafe Spall 10:43 Yeah, that's good. What about Welsh?
Ed Gamble 10:46 Ah Welsh. You need a word to get into it, don't you? Yes. Hello. I'm from Wales. That's good.
Rafe Spall 10:52 Thats good, you gone a bit Tom Jones there n all.
Ed Gamble 10:54 Ay
Rafe Spall 10:56 One more, what about, heres one that I can't get anywhere near, Northern Irish.
Ed Gamble 11:01 Northern Irish. I'm not too bad at, because my granddad was from Larne.
Rafe Spall 11:05 You enjoyed saying the word Larne then, didn't you?
James Acaster 11:07 He loves saying Larne.
Rafe Spall 11:08 Yeah, you like that.
James Acaster 11:09 So if someone asked you to audition and play in Northern Irish person, Rafe, you would have to say no.
Rafe Spall 11:14 I probably would have to say no, I've thought about this. It seems to be, and one of my best friends is Northern Irish. But it seems to me, I can get the the rhythm of it, which is da da da da da ba da da ba da da ba da da da.
Ed Gamble 11:24 Yes. But you can't do all your lines like that. Can you

Off Menu ­ Ep 102: Rafe Spall
Rafe Spall 11:27 No I can't, you can'y do em all like that, wouldn't wash. People wouldn't like it.
Ed Gamble 11:31 Imagine if you got offered the part. You told them you could do the accent. You get to a read through table read. And it comes to your first line.
Rafe Spall 11:38 Ah ba da ba da ba da ba da ba da ba da.
Ed Gamble 11:40 How long do you think you'd last at the table read? If you just did all your lines like that before? They just said you have to leave?
Rafe Spall 11:46 People will probably laugh the first time you did it because it was a hilarious, very brave joke. But then it. You got that guy's got some balls to pull off a joke on his first line at a table read. Good on him. Right? But then if you carried on, you'd be asked to leave. I actually was once fired after a table read. I've never shared this before.
James Acaster 12:04 Did you try and get back in with your socks of your shoes?
Rafe Spall 12:09 Very good. No, it didn't. If only I'd thought of that, no, it was it was for a radio play. And I've never done any, cuz I didn't go to drama school, I've never done any Shakespeare or like a verse reading or that sort of thing. And it was for like some sort of like John Webster play, and when I went along, and there was Rory Kinnear was there to know the actor, who's perhaps one of our finest classical actors.
James Acaster 12:31 He fucks the pig?
Rafe Spall 12:31 Yeah, he fucked the pig, yeah. Yeah. In real life, no, in black mirror. And they're all like the best classical actors of their generation, and I bought a york note before going to this thing, to try and work it out, and I did the read through and afterwards the director said, What's your problem? What What happened? And I said, I did tell you I've never done this sort of thing before, and he said i think is best you leave. I said, but my my bag is still in the other room where everyone else. And I had to go in and get my bag. Can you imagine.
James Acaster 13:01 Were you waiting to get your bag? Did you pretend like you were still in the play?

I think I might have said something about a family emergency. An emergency.
Ed Gamble 13:08 Yeah. Just garbled something about an emergency, too the bag and run out.
Rafe Spall 13:12 But they knew, they knew what had happened.
Ed Gamble 13:14 So they all knew in the room, when you went to get your bag that you've been fired.
Rafe Spall 13:18 I think they knew it was going very poorly for me in this read through and then I think they were told after I'd left it that I had, in fact, been fired.
Ed Gamble 13:25 Man, that's painful.
Rafe Spall 13:26 You ever been fired?
Ed Gamble 13:27 It's difficult to be fired, doing stand up comedy a lot of the time because they tend to be one off gigs. If you're fired from a stand up comedy gig, it's gone very badly. You're halfway through the set and they're like, no, this isn't working out. It's time to leave.
Rafe Spall 13:41 You're gonna have to go.
James Acaster 13:42 I had that. I mean, I may have told this story on the podcast before. But I had a gig once where it was going really badly, and the audience were just all talking over me. It's Bedlam. And there was someone in the front, who really hated me who was screaming at me how shit I was. A bit of 'Your Shit' and all this, and then the guy who owned the venue, went over to security and pointed at this guy in the front row and went, he needs to go, but I was doing so badly that the security guard thought he was pointing at me. So the security just walked up, and so this guy's yelling at me at the front going, you are shit, you're not even fucking funny. And then I saw the security guard coming up behind him and I was like, cavalry's arrived. You're about to get chucked out you piece of shit. But so i'm lettin him shout at me. And then the security guy just walked past this guy up onto the stage right up to me adn he went, you need to go. And I was like, Okay, fine. I don't like this anyway, and I left and then they made me go back on and then explain to them what happened.
Ed Gamble 14:34 What!

Rafe Spall 14:35 did that bring it back round?
James Acaster 14:36 No, it did not. It went worse. Because I will tell you, I said, Oh, I'm being chucked out. The audience cheer. I go off stage. The manager comes up to me says that was a mistake. I was like, yeah, I'm pretty sure it's a mistake. I'm happy to just ride it out. It's like no, no, I need you to go back on, and so I went back on and told them what happened and they still don't like me and the guy on the front went, I thought they'd sent you to get a proper comedian, and all this. And then I made, this is a big mistake, but I did it. I went they did send me to get a proper comedian. And it's you. So everyone welcomed this guy to the stage. So then I gave him the mic. He went onstage, I sat in his seat, because they're already, you know, a pack of wolves. So he goes on, and they give him a little chance. And he says, some, he says some joke at the top, it doesn't work. And then they really turn on him, it gets really ugly. And then he starts panicking and turning to me and trying to hand me back the mic, and I just shook my head and sat there went, No, this is your gig now, which is a very unprofessional thing to do Rafe. And it just got worse and worse until the whole place was not really a gig anymore. Actually, it was a bit of a riot.
Rafe Spall 15:40 Did you feel good about that? Or did you feel did you begin to feel guilty when it was happening?
James Acaster 15:44 I felt good when I shook my head at him. And then when it descended into, this is now un-win-backable and we can't back from this. I felt really bad for it.
Rafe Spall 15:55 You were the equivalent of, as Danny Dyer put it, in Nice with your trotters up
James Acaster 16:00 I was in Nice with my Trotters up.
Ed Gamble 16:01 But I'd say that's being fired. You definitely got fired there.
James Acaster 16:04 I got fired.
Ed Gamble 16:05 But Rafe, you haven't been fired from trying, of course, very excited that there's a second series.
Rafe Spall 16:10 Yeah, me too.

Ed Gamble 16:11 Where did we leave your character in series one. And what's changed.
Rafe Spall 16:15 The first season is about a couple who try and have a baby together, but they're not able to naturally conceive. So they decide to adopt. And then the whole first season is about them being approved for adoption. And now it's about getting matched with a kid. Lots of bittersweet moments insue. It's about something and it's also funny, and the more I do stuff, I only want to be in things that are funny, because everything's funny, and, you know, I've done like Ibsen and shit like it at National Theatre A few years ago, and even that should be funny. It's like, even if there's, if there's, if there was a laugh to be had, let's have it and it's a crime not to. There has been very few moments in my life where some form of comedy hasn't been brought from it and that's the sort of work I want to do. And this reflects that.
James Acaster 17:03 Sometimes where you go and see like a proper serious play. And the whole thing is serious, but there's like the occasional comedic line in there. It gets such a massive laugh, because people aren't expecting it, out of nowhere. And then as a comedian, I'm sat there absolutely seething because i'm like,
Ed Gamble 17:17 It really makes comedians so angry. Theatre are crowds like laughing at tiny jokes, because everyone's so tense all the time in the theatre. I don't know. That's how I feel when I go watch a play. I'm so worried for everyone involved. And then if it's serious, and there's one little joke, everyone's like, Oh, thank God for that. We're all here. We're alive.
Rafe Spall 17:33 You know what, I had my first, I mean, I'm embarrassed saying it to you. But I did have one person play at the National Theatre last year, right, called Death of England. And I watched hours and hours and hours of stand up, like I mean, I'm a huge stand up fan anyway, right? I love it. So I watched everything. And everyone and I had my first taste of what that would be like to do stand up comedy as an actor. And there was a lot of like audience participation and talking to people and improvising and stuff. And I have to say, it's easy, it was easy. Turns out bloody easy. No no, it wasn't. It gave me It gave me It gave me even more respect. But what I did realise is again, from a layman's point of view, and I say this with my head bowed, is the sort of power that you have in speaking to, going back to your heckler thing, I know that people will probably always be bore onto you about hecklers and stuff. But like the amount of power that you have as the person on stage, if someone says anything, ain't gotta be that good, your come back, people are generally on your side. right? Is that is that true?
Ed Gamble 18:31 Yeah, I think that's fair. And also the audience knows instinctively that anything you say back is in the moment and unique and people are so much more on board with anything they feel is special to that night,

Right? That's interesting.
James Acaster 18:42 Also, if you've learned very quickly, a very key rule in stand up, a good thing to remember is that the whole audience is on your side. It's a big lesson that I only learned when you said it just then.
Ed Gamble 18:57 Yeah, James James sort of takes the opposite way of doing things when he walks on, he's like, oh god.
James Acaster 19:02 It's all insecurities and stuff, innit. But yeah,
Rafe Spall 19:04 yeah, but you'll go and, but you're going but you're you're at the level now where everyone's coming to see your shows tho. So everyone is on side right? People are coming to see you, you're not
James Acaster 19:12 you are talking out of your ass. That is not the case. One in each group are there to see me
Ed Gamble 19:20 James sees it as more enemies.
Rafe Spall 19:22 Yes.
Ed Gamble 19:23 That's what he sees big audiences as.
James Acaster 19:25 They all bring their mates who don't know me. But yeah, it's just it's all in my head most of the time. And I should have that approach of going, they all want you to succeed, even the ones who don't know who you are. They want you to do well, cause they don't want to be in an awkward situation where they're watching someone bomb.
Rafe Spall 19:40 No, exactly, no, but I get that. I get it. And I have a similar thing sometimes when I do plays, and it because you know, I mean, you know what it's like. An audience exists as a sort of organic thing unto itself and certain bits that get massive laughs usually one night won't for whatever reason. Then you'll get strange laugh in another place and you can end up despising the audience. And I get it when I'm like well, there's actually a big laugh coming up but you're not going to fucking get, so i'm not even gonna, you don't deserve it. You don't deserve it. I'm not even gonna give it to you.

James Acaster 20:26 We always start with still or sparkling water for your meal, Rafe.
Ed Gamble 20:29 Although today we're starting with still or bubbly fresh?
James Acaster 20:31 Oh, yeah. Still a bubbly fresh, absolutley. Do you know what, I respect Ed so much. He's had that up his sleeve since you said it.
Rafe Spall 20:38 Yeah, it's very good.
James Acaster 20:41 He's like I know when the time is to drop that. Yeah.
Rafe Spall 20:43 Yeah, yeah. Well done.
Ed Gamble 20:45 Just let James get through his breakdown about stand-up and then I'm ready to do my lovely fresh joke.
Rafe Spall 20:49 I enjoyed it. I am. Okay. I guzzle bubbly fresh water all day every day. Yeah, I'm addicted to it. I've heard some quite hefty SodaStream content on this podcast before and I am in possession of one and probably my favourite drink in the world, up there, is fizzy water with orange squash.
James Acaster 21:13 Oh, hello. First of all, is it a pint glass, is it a small glass? And then how much squash are you putting into bubbly fresh water?
Rafe Spall 21:21 If I had, if I had a pint glass, I would use a pint glass. But it's sort of one of them in between a pint and a half pint glasses. You know that ones I mean. And I'm going to put about an inch and a half in.
Ed Gamble 21:32 Yeah, a pretty good measure.

Rafe Spall 21:57 They're confused but they comply, because they have to.
Ed Gamble 21:59 Is that because fizzy waters too fizzy for her?

Rafe Spall 22:06 Indeed. Yeah, so she'll have half and half. Thank you very much. But for me in this restaurant. I'll have Robinson's orange squash in there please.

You're going to get six pieces in nigiri on a on a plate, arn't you? Tricolori, thats nothing. The creamed polenta and mushrooms, you ever had that?
James Acaster 32:13 No,
Ed Gamble 32:14 I've had polenta before. Not had it with mushrooms before.
Rafe Spall 32:16 Yeah, cream, creamed polenta. That's a really good thing to cook in your house, you know? Creamed polenta, you put a bit cream in it and parmesan. It's easy and lovely.
James Acaster 32:25 And what, you can blend that together or what you do?
Rafe Spall 32:27 Yeah, you got a whisk it. So so you you boil a bit of milk and then some butter. And then carefully sieving the polenta slowly and whisk it, and then you put in lots of parmesan and more butter and cream. And you just whisk it and it's all sort of oozy and lovely. It's really good.
James Acaster 32:44 Are you dipping the pita bread from the hummus into that as well
Rafe Spall 32:47 No, thats double carb. That would be too much, because what you're going to do with, so you'd use polenta where you would maybe use pasta so it's nice with bolognese sauce or something. In this case, just a bit of mushrooms.

Rafe Spall 33:10 I like it when you know you go to a restaurant and then the waiter brings out his own little table. You know when they do that? He brings out his own little table. He opens it, constantina opens it and puts it down you know you're somewhere special when that happens. You do that? And then I like banquettes. You always feel nice when you're in banqettes, don't you? Yeah, in a restaurant, and it will be a sort of large oval table.

Rafe Spall 33:30 Where you can still speak speak to everyone. So it would all go in the middle, all within arm's reach of me.
James Acaster 33:35 And that salad is very specific, and I haven't heard of it before. Is that a place you've had this salad? Or is it something you've always had growing up? Watermelon duck and cashew salad. I'm not familiar with it myself.
Rafe Spall 33:47 Do you know what, I love going to restaurants, yeah, it's probably my favourite thing to do. And I'm going to sort of portray myself as being rather grand now. You can get it in the Ivy, right?
Ed Gamble 33:55 Yeah,
Rafe Spall 33:56 There you go. But also they do it at a sort of pan-Asian restaurant called E-N-O. The cashews are sort of caramelised and then the watermelons really fresh and then the duck is like sort of, you know, like you would get in a Chinese restaurant sort of like taken apart with forks.

Rafe Spall 34:29 James?
James Acaster 34:30 Well, I do love those meats. The thing is, if one thing that you've got to eat forever, is different to me to something that you favourite. Because if I've got to eat one meat forever, I will probably let both of you down and choose chicken.
Ed Gamble 34:42 I can understand that though.
James Acaster 34:43 But like, you know, if I think of like dishes that I've had that are the best dishes. I've had better lamb dishes, beef dishes and even duck dishes, than I have chicken dishes. Beef would probably win. If I think of like, yeah, the best meals I've had.

So I'd always drive about with a provisional licence. And then in a sort of fit of peak I was a bit like,oh fine then I'll just book it. So then I just booked a test and then fought nothing of it. And then remembered that I had this test coming up in a couple of days and I mean lessons and, so I thought, fuck, I'm just gonna fucking go. I'm going to see what happens, right. So I went on the I went on the YouTube and I saw about how to do it. And then Elise took me around some roundabouts, which I still struggle with to this day, right?
James Acaster 40:08 Yeah, you'd never had a lesson in your life.
Rafe Spall 40:09 Yeah, exactly. I'd never had a lesson. And then I went along, somehow pulled it off. The guy said to me, the guy said to me, now, I'm gonna pass you, but this is the lowest pass I've ever given out. This is the lowest, this is the lowest one I've ever done. I want you to know that. Well a pass is a pass, innit? And yeah, so there you go. Now look at me a danger on the roads.
James Acaster 40:32 Imagine having to say that to someone. Just so you know, I'm passing you but I don't want this on my conscience completely, so i'm gonna let you know, that this is, you've scraped through by the skin of your teeth.
Ed Gamble 40:42 I had a really low pass as well. And I think my, the person who took my test only passed me because she was clearly hung over. So like, every so often, she would ask me to stop she'd wind down a window and start breathing quite heavily. So because of that, I think she passed me out of guilt.
Rafe Spall 40:58 First time?
Ed Gamble 40:59 First time. Yeah. But we'd like whatever the maximum amount of minors you're allowed. But when when we went to take the test, my instructor took me and you sit there and wait for the examiner to come out,

and my instructor knew all the examiners, and they will come out and they pick up your sheet or whatever and read your name out. I can't believe that this didn't affect my test result at all. The examiner was quite short and round. And she came and picked up the sheet and he went, really loudly he went, Oh, no, you've got Barney Rubble, like that loudly, you've got Barney Rubble. I was like, fuckin hell, shut up.
James Acaster 41:34 And then you do a do a test with your feet through the car and running around all the time.
James Acaster 41:47 Move on to your main course, Rafe. Yeah, that started was a smorgasbord sounded delicious.
Rafe Spall 41:51 Well the smorgas is going to continue. So again, I'm ordering for the table. Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna get, there's this restaurant now which is sadly closed in New York City called the spotted pig and they had a burger there which, for me, and I've had many is probably the best one I've ever had. That's a cheeseburger with string fries. Very, very thin fries and loads of them. I'd also get a porterhouse steak you know the porterhouse being a fillet on one side, serloin on the other with a big T-bone down the middle. Now I want that cooked Chicago style. Do you know about Chicago style? Yeah? Which is black and blue. So so you it's very, very chard on the outside and very rare on the inside. And then I want a melanzane parmigiana. Right? And also, I want a chicken burrito, and some guacamole to share, please.
James Acaster 42:42 So, okay. How did you discover that? How did you discover that you'd like to stake Chicago style? First of all.
Rafe Spall 42:54 Because, I was with someone who I thought was quite cool and they said it, and so I asked what it was and it was really good. And actually like there's a chain of steak restaurants in Canada called black and blue. And I asked what black and blue was, and that is the way of cooking a steak black on the outside blue on the inside. And it's called, for whatever reason, Chicago style.
Ed Gamble 43:12 It sounds like the way I have often done steaks by accident on a barbecue. Yeah, I know. It should be called British barbecue style, really.
James Acaster 43:22 How Chicago got that offer is?
Rafe Spall 43:24 I know, It's so true. It's so true. And the thicker of the steak the more difficult it is to cook but I think you need to lean into it. What you go for when you get a steak, how to order it?

Ed Gamble 43:34 I tend to say rare.
Rafe Spall 43:35 Oh, so you'd like Chicago style.
Ed Gamble 43:36 I think I'd love Chicago style. I've had it in Italian restaurants before as well, where they do like bistecca, I think its Fiorentina, like Florence style.
Rafe Spall 43:44 That's right.
Ed Gamble 43:45 Steak. and is that the same sort of thing is like really, really rare.
Rafe Spall 43:48 Yeah, exactly. What about you, James? How do you get your steak?
James Acaster 43:51 Medium rare, usually. It's you know, it's not completely basic, but it's pretty basic. Innit.
Ed Gamble 43:56 I think it's a solid order.
Rafe Spall 43:57 No, but it says something about you. It says that you've got a bit of danger about you do you know what I mean. If you said medium or medium well, that might be quite unattractive.
James Acaster 44:08 Greg Davis came on this podcast and said, that was he dream meal was a well done steak. And fillet as well.
Rafe Spall 44:18 A well done fillet? What's wrong with him?
Ed Gamble 44:21 We tried to work it out. It's a shame innit.
Rafe Spall 44:22 It is a shame. Because he seems like a good fella.

Rafe Spall 44:28 So I've got some, if there's any vegetarians there, the melanzane parmigiana for the vegetarians. That's lovely, innit? You ever had that?
James Acaster 44:39 I'm not sure I have
Rafe Spall 44:40 Oh mate, aubergine and parmesan. Off.
James Acaster 44:43 Lovley. I had an aubergine just before we started this.
Rafe Spall 44:45 Hang about, you said that when Dolly Alderton was on your thing as well. You said you had that aubergine. You're obsessed by em.
Ed Gamble 44:51 Yes. He is obsessed with it. Called you out on it straight away.
James Acaster 44:57 You're absolutely right. Yeah, you got me.
Rafe Spall 44:59 Yeah, you're obsessed by those melanzanes. You need to look at it. Did you put it under the grill again? scoop it all up with a spoon, like a yogurt.
James Acaster 45:09 Yeah, that is what I did, actually yeah. That's exactly what I did.
Rafe Spall 45:14 Look augergine is very versatile and it's lovely. But really, I respect that because you're eating it as it comes. Because really, aubergine tastes of what you put on it. Like do you put a bit of oil on it or whatever.
James Acaster 45:28 Olive oil lemon juice, salt pepper.
Rafe Spall 45:30 Lovely. And that's it?
James Acaster 45:31 Garlic pepper. Yeah. I use the garlic pepper.

Rafe Spall 45:34 Very nice. Do you like masaka?
James Acaster 45:36 Yeah, I like it. I made a vegetarian masaka, during lockdown with aubergines, actually. Yeah, very good.
Rafe Spall 45:42 It's quite laborious, though, isn't it? Because you've gotta, in fact, takes a while. Gotta cut em all up, cook em and all that. Yeah. They really absorb oil don't they, really absorb it. Yeah. Yeah, you put as much as you want. Whats the deal with that.
Ed Gamble 45:57 I respect that, you know. I feel like an augergine sometimes. It's the vegetable I most associate with as a guy, I think.
Rafe Spall 46:02 Do you use a whole carton of suncreen? When you put it on? Is it just soak into your skin.
Ed Gamble 46:07 Just straight in. It's awful
James Acaster 46:10 I mean, I can really relate to what you just said about absorbing oil, actually. And it's something that recently I've had problems with when I'm grilling my aubergines. Is that when I pour the oil on, wherever it is, that exact spot that I put the oil on, it goes right in there and then I can't spread it, and what I need is like an oil glaze curtain like they have for donuts, you know, when donuts go through the conveyor belt for the glaze curtain. That's what I need, is an olive oil glazed curtain in my flat.
Ed Gamble 46:34 Have you thought about a spray situation. You could mist it.
James Acaster 46:37 I could mist it, that would be good.
Rafe Spall 46:38 Also a brush, you ain't got a brush?
James Acaster 46:40 No, I think I need to invest in a brush, if I'm gonna keep it in these aubergines like this.
Rafe Spall 46:44

Heres the thing as well, is actually weirdly, and someone told me recently that when it comes to cooking aubergines, and this sounds counterintuitive, but if you were to actually like deep fry them, right, they absorb less oil If you cook them in loads and throw them in. For some reason, they don't. They cook nicely without absorbing all the oil. So the more oil you put in, the less they absorb, strangely. But if you like your aubergines, then you need to get on an aubergine parmigiana, its lovley.
Ed Gamble 47:11 I love i augbergine parmigiana. That was part of my Fatboy lunch tour that I do most days. Where I'd get down the high street and go to the deli and buy aubergine parmigiana and a sandwich and then go to Gregg's and get a couple of pasties and then go to the corner shop and buy a pack of biscuits and then go back to my mom's house.
Rafe Spall 47:28 That's mad, I'd do similar things. I would go to the cafe and I would get a full breakfast with four slices of toast. And then I would go to the shops and I would get Mars bar, topic, twirl, lion bar, crisps and Milky Way stars.
Ed Gamble 47:47 Perfect. That's pudding.
James Acaster 47:48 Eating all those in one sitting?
Rafe Spall 47:50 Oh yeah. What you talking about? You're not gonna spread them out. They're going straight down. And that's breakfast. Thast before lunch. But I was also, that was in a period of my life when I was smoking a lot of weed as well. So that sort of goes together. But yeah, no, but the thing is, you can't do that anymore and try and be an actor or whatever. So this is why this is so lovely for me because this is this is those rules don't exist. I can go back to those halcian days of milky bars for breakfast.
Ed Gamble 48:17 Rafe, I feel like if we ever met in real life and went out for a meal, it would be the end of both of us.
Rafe Spall 48:22 Yeah, we'd just get a big trough.
Ed Gamble 48:24 I think we'd egg each other on and it would be so bad. And next thing you know we're in the corner shop at breakfast.
James Acaster 48:31 This is how bad it would be. If Ed rang me up one day in the morning and said, James what you up to today? I said nothing, got nothing planned. and he went I'm gonna go meet up with Rafe Spall, we're going to get some food you want to come, I'd go no.

Rafe Spall 48:47 I've got some aubergine to eat. Thank you very much.
Ed Gamble 48:50 I've bought a spray.
James Acaster 48:51 No way i'm going to that, too hardcore for me.
Rafe Spall 48:53 It would be quite hardcore.
James Acaster 48:55 I mean, really, we should get onto your side dish, although I really want to know about the chicken burrito. That was suddenly in there at the end, a chicken burrito.
Rafe Spall 49:04 Because I could easily eat Mexican food for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Every day. Every day. And I think I think if there was one cuisine that I'd eat forever, one country whos food I could live on forever, it will probably be Mexico. I spent quite a lot of time in Los Angeles, I made a TV show there a few years ago. And yeah, it's that LA, Mexican food is something else.
James Acaster 49:27 And is it from anywhere in particular this chicken burrito?
Rafe Spall 49:30 Yeah, a restaurant in Venice Beach called Casa Linda and I would go there every evening and have that. Because I get into a routine where if I'm away filming or working or whatever, and I find one place I go to that one place every day and eat the same thing. And I'm also happy in the same thing for lunch every day, and I generally generally do, and then I'll get sick of it. Like for years I ate a pita bread with tuna in it, every day for like about three years. Every day. And only after three years did I get sick of it. It wasn't like a gradual process of like, I'm getting bored of this now. I was happy until that last one, and then I just stopped because I thought this is this is,
Ed Gamble 50:08 Its just that final bite and then you're like, I'm never having this again.
Rafe Spall 50:11 Exactly. It was a tuna with fetta hummus, jalapenos and some cucumbers. Because I hummus and feta every single day of my life. Not a day goes by.

James Acaster 50:27 you work it into other stuff?
Rafe Spall 50:29 Yeah, yeah,
Ed Gamble 50:30 You're sneaking it into whatever.
Rafe Spall 50:31 Because, there's not that many meals in my opinion that can't be improved with the addition of feta cheese. It goes with most things. You can even put it on curry get away with it. I wouldn't advise it but it wouldn't ruin it, would it?
Ed Gamble 50:44 You wouldn't serve that to a guest, that would do that something, if you're having a curry and you're by yourself. You're like go on.
Rafe Spall 50:49 Chana masala this feta. No, I wouldn't do that. No, but I'd be tempted to try it by myself. And then hummus, hummus I'd devour the stuff. A pot a dat, easy.
James Acaster 51:00 Has feta come up on your menu yet?
Rafe Spall 51:01 No, because I would have had that for lunch. I would have had it for lunch.
Ed Gamble 51:05 Also, Rafe's point is, is you could put it on anything that he's had so far. So would you like us to bring you a big like a big bowl of feta and you can just sprinkle it on whenever you feel like it.
Rafe Spall 51:15 Yeah, okay. Yeah, that'd be nice.
Rafe Spall 51:24 I've got some extensive sides.

James Acaster 51:28 Rafe, I'd be absolutely stunned if we went sides? And you went, just chips.
Ed Gamble 51:31 Brocolli.
Rafe Spall 51:35 The burger. That terrific burger, which would also be medium rare comes with them string fries, but I also want other fries. Okay, and then I want some dauphinoise potatoes. I want some simple fresh things like a pickled cucumber salad. And I also want a tomato and red onion salad. But then also want some truffle macaroni. Now, the thing with a truffle macaroni is, there's this restaurant, a fancy restaurant in New York City called The Waverly, and they they come and take your order, and they they always say to you, Oh, we just wanna let you know that the special that we have on is this macaroni cheese with truffle on it. You go Oh, that sounds nice, and they suggest that you get it for the table to, you know. And also what they do in America is they tell you the price of this special and it's $100. So I've never ordered it because that would be ridiculous to order it. But now I'm going to, because I'm going to kill myself with this meal and I care about the price.
James Acaster 52:29 Sure, it doesn't matter.
Rafe Spall 52:30 I've left my family. I'm eating myself to death with Jesus Christ. So i'm gonna get the truffle macaroni for the table.
James Acaster 52:41 So have you ever had it before? No. Never had it. You've not bought it but you've not this like no one else has ordered it and you've had a bit. You don't know what it tastes like?
Rafe Spall 52:48 No one's dead. You've got to have some serious chutzpah to go Yeah, I'll have that. If they go the truffle macaroni at $100, you've got to be a bit of a baller.
James Acaster 52:56 I think you know some ballers, don't you?
Rafe Spall 52:58 I do know some ballers.

James Acaster 53:09 And you got those different salads,
Rafe Spall 53:11 Nice little salads. You got to cut through it with the vinegar in the pickled cucumber salad. So that's like, very finely chopped up cucumber, in a sort of vinegar with a bit of dill.
James Acaster 53:24 Dill and pickle.
Rafe Spall 53:25 Diall and pickle. Classic.
James Acaster 53:26 What a lovely match.
Rafe Spall 53:27 Oh, I missed something out.

Rafe Spall 53:33 Jesus wouldn't want it. Zucchini fritti.
Rafe Spall 53:35 Nice, so courgette chips
Rafe Spall 53:38 Yeah. Courgettes with parmesan on them and then deep fry, please.
Ed Gamble 53:43 Are you having a little bit of everything? Or are you in danger that you might end up getting focused on one thing and having too much and then filling yourself up?
Rafe Spall 53:52 I'm worried because a burger is. Okay. So a burger is hard to share. Yeah? So that would be my main, and then all the other ones would be I'll have a bit of and a bit of that. Maybe half of the burrito. And

then I'd pick at the steak, and then you know, I'd enjoy a reasonable portion of the melanzane parmigiana. And then, I'd go to town on the sides because the the sides, you know, sides are fun, aren't they? Everyone loves sides.
James Acaster 54:19 So you've got the string fries?
Rafe Spall 54:20 Yeah.
James Acaster 54:21 And you said you want some other fries, but just french fries or thick cut chips?
Rafe Spall 54:25 No, I don't want thick cut chips. Look, if you bring me thick cut chips. I'm not going to be upset about it, but I'm going to choose very salty, thin crispy chips. Do you think theres many people that would, maybe you two gentlemen would, would choose a thick cut fry over a thin one?
James Acaster 54:39 We've weirdly had some people on the podcast who have said that, it always surprises me. I think the thinner ones are by far superior.
Rafe Spall 54:45 Gotta be.
Ed Gamble 54:45 Sometimes you just send the mood for chip shop chips though. Thick soggy ones, that's what you're in the mood for. Covered in vinegar. But on a night out, you know, you're at a restaurant, I'd always go thin fries. Unless I was somewhere where I knew they were like legit thick, really crispy fries. Someone like Hawksmore that do big chips. But they're like, they're really crispy. I'd go for them.
James Acaster 55:07 You might be the guest that we've had on this podcast, Who is the most like Ed. You are exactly like him.
Rafe Spall 55:14 I'll take that.
James Acaster 55:15 Even down to that moment then Benito where they both just laughed. Make sure we use that for the picture when we tweet it, because you looked exactly the same.

Ed Gamble 55:34 I've never done that.
Rafe Spall 55:34 I do. I do. You've got to get yourself a deep fat fryer. Because they are, they're terrific. A lovely meal, and everyone's happy to eat this if they come to your house for dinner. Chicken and chips. Roast chicken, chips, bit of salad. That's lovely. Thats a happy dinner that is, and everyone's gonna be happy to eat that.
Rafe Spall 55:38 Are you cutting up the potatoes yourself and getting them thin?
Rafe Spall 55:52 Oh, god yeah. Yea. But you got but you get them all nice and thin. And you've got to wash that startch off em. And then you've got to dry em all, which can take a while. But just stick them on a tea towel, pat them off. And then do them in batches. And cook them three times. Come in for a bit. Take them out. Let them rest, again. Let them rest again. Even when you first put the chicken in. Do the chips, just do the chips. Five minutes. Take them out halfway, do them again. Just before you serve the chicken smash them in there again. And they are truly wonderful.
James Acaster 56:21 And then you're ready for your potato dauphinoise .
Rafe Spall 56:24 Yeah. You're going for the dauphinoise. Dauphinoise is terrific tho, innit?

I do like Dijon, but I'll go English, and then, bit of ketchup, vinegar, as you said, Ed, for the chips. I was gonna say some tartar, but there's no fish to speak of is there? But maybe I'll get a bit of tartar anyway.
Ed Gamble 57:02 Why not? While you're there.
James Acaster 57:08 Let's hear what your dream drink is.
Rafe Spall 57:10 So I've had I've had two martinis to start off. You don't want to you don't want more than two martinis. Like, because then you feel it and you want to enjoy the meal.
Ed Gamble 57:19 I've taken two drinking martinis at home which is very dangerous, especially if you then need to cook a meal. So if you have two martinis and then you've got to cook a meal, it is a recipe for injury.
Rafe Spall 57:28 There's two here that I've got alongside, I've done them, I've done the martinis and the lager. There's one softy. Another softy which is not the orange squash, and then there's a then there's some more booze.
James Acaster 57:38 Okay,
Rafe Spall 57:39 So one of them is Diet Coke. Now I've given it up. I gave up years ago because I was addicted to this stuff, right? I used to nail it, destroy it, and i'd have five cans a day easy for about 15 years. Yeah? And then I thought this can't be good. And someone pointed out to me, they said, Just think of it as the sort of thing that would be kept under the sink. And that stuck with me, because it's a chemical as that. It worked, it worked.
James Acaster 58:05 Well look, I'll tell you this about diet coke and I know earlier on you called me out for talkin about aubergine, and I'd already talked about it on another episode, but here's something brand new for you. I, in 2013 I think, I gave up caffeine, and for five years I just didn't have any caffeine at all. And then I started drinking Diet Coke after five years because I hadn't had any caffeine, it tasted like normal coke. It tasted like normal coke.

Now, Rafe. He's told that story on this podcast so many times that when you started saying you gave up Diet Coke I thought you were going to do the story back at him. That's where we're at with that. I thought you were repurposing the story to throw back in his face.
Rafe Spall 58:44 No, I wasn't repurposing it, no this is genuine. I'm interested. So, but so have you since given it up again, James, or are you still on it?
James Acaster 58:50 I've given up Diet Coke and now I'm on to Diet Pepsi. I prefer Diet Pepsi. It tastes better. It's a better drink.
Rafe Spall 58:56 Max? We're talking max?
James Acaster 58:58 Just normal diet Pepsi there, or Cherry Pepsi Max. Me and Ed are fans of that.
Ed Gamble 59:02 Yeah, love cherry Pepsi max.
James Acaster 59:03 He's with me there. If you've ever had cherry Pepsi Max, Rafe. I'd warn you against it because it sounds like it'd be worse than your diet coke addiction.
Rafe Spall 59:12 I'll be back in the caf, wouldn't I?
James Acaster 59:14 Absolutely, you'll be putting your dad's cloudy lemonade addiction to shame.
Ed Gamble 59:18 There'd be a chug of a family Christmas.
James Acaster 59:23 So you got Diet Coke.
Rafe Spall 59:24 Money and health is no object. That's our slogan on this podcast.
Rafe Spall 59:24 And then I like wine. I like wine. And so there's a fancy wine from a place called Château Latour, which is a claret, and it will probably be from maybe 1990. That sort of time. At 30 years old, bottle of that

Rafe Spall 59:30 Can you ever see yourself in a situation where you're going to order an eight grand bottle of wine, because, I mean is that, or its eighty mac and cheeses, isn't it?
Ed Gamble 59:50 Yeah, thats a good question. Can I ever see myself? I don't know. Like, how rich have you got to be, how rich have youn got to be to not even blink at that.
Ed Gamble 1:00:05 I think you've got to be like proper proper loaded. Haven't you?
Rafe Spall 1:00:10 Or a proper cunt. Its one of the two isn't it.
Ed Gamble 1:00:15 Yes.
Rafe Spall 1:00:15 It's either you're so rich or you're just a proper cunt. Or, both. Yeah.
Ed Gamble 1:00:21 Yeah, and they often do crossover. The Venn diagram is pretty,
Rafe Spall 1:00:24 On the Venn diagram, there is a sweet spot. Yeah, exactly. So I think I can't ever see myself doing that. No, but I do, I do collect wine. I've got some wine.

Rafe Spall 1:00:39 Well, I, Yes,I do. And I, because because I moved to, I live in the countryside. And I moved to a house with a cellar in it and the people owned before me, they racked up with all wine racks. And so I thought, well, I should put some wines in there. So i suppose yes, I do have a wine cellar. Yeah.
Ed Gamble 1:00:56 That's my dream.
Rafe Spall 1:00:57 Is it?

Ed Gamble 1:00:57 Yeah, cos I really like wine. But I've only just started getting into it, really.
Rafe Spall 1:01:01 Yeah, me too.
Ed Gamble 1:01:01 And I don't have any space to store it really. So it's just sort of about the place. And my fiance is a bit like, are you going to drink some of this before you get the new stuff? And i'm like, that's not the point.
Rafe Spall 1:01:10 But I find the idea of dying with a wine cellar. Really sad. Like, you know what I mean, you want to drink it or what? You got to drink it. Yeah, you can become quite miserly about it and go Yeah, touch that one. But you know, there's a sort of sad poetry in the idea of dying with a fully stocked wine cellar.
James Acaster 1:01:29 Well you can leave it to Ed in your will.
Ed Gamble 1:01:30 Yes, please.
Rafe Spall 1:01:31 I will. Yeah. I will in my will.
Ed Gamble 1:01:33 I'm sure your family will really appreciate that, me turning up on your front doorstep.
James Acaster 1:01:36 But very quickly they'll discover, this man is exactly like Rafe.
Rafe Spall 1:01:42 Do you know what, this is now down. You can choose a bottle of reasonably, you could come and choose a bottle of wine from my wine cellar, to the amount of about 20 pounds. I'll give you one. You can come down when I pass away. If you outlive me, I'll say this to my wife. This is, on this podcast, help yourself, go down there to a nice bottle of 20 pound wine.
James Acaster 1:02:06 That'll be a very sad bonus episode that we do.
Ed Gamble 1:02:08 How soon after you pass do you think it's appropriate for me to arrive at your house to get my £20 bottle of wine?

Thats your judgment to make, mate. I'm not helping you out with that, thats a toughy. Puddin, are you ready for some pudding?
James Acaster 1:02:21 Yeah, always, well i'm worried.
Rafe Spall 1:02:24 No, I'm going to surprise you. I'm gonna surprise you. No, you're gonna be surprised. It's just one. This one puddin?
James Acaster 1:02:29 Yeah, but I'm worried because you're very similar to Ed. So I'm very worried about what this pudding is gonna be.
Rafe Spall 1:02:34 It's just it's Ben and Jerry's Caramel Choo Choo.
Ed Gamble 1:02:37 Oh, he's absolutley done it.
James Acaster 1:02:39 Yes, yes please.
Ed Gamble 1:02:42 I've never seen James go from such worry to such relief. That's the best thing you could have said to put James at ease.
James Acaster 1:02:47 So happy. Also, though, to me, that's fascinating, because obviously I love ice cream. I love Ben and Jerry's. I do love caramel choo choo. But that is your one that you've chosen. And yeah, Caramel Choo Choo is the one that I forget how good it is. And then when I have it, those little cups of Carmel encased in chocolate. The way they crack in your mouth when you buy into him is very satisfying.
Rafe Spall 1:03:12 Stop it. Also the caramel swirl that goes down to the middle of it, its Heaven. It's lovely. I love ice cream. And it's probably my favourite food.
James Acaster 1:03:20 Yes.
Rafe Spall 1:03:21 Yeah. Ice cream at number one.

The twist at the end.
Ed Gamble 1:03:24 Yeah, he was like you all along.
Rafe Spall 1:03:27 My kids always said, you know, kids always ask question like, What's your favourite colour? you know, what's your favourite foods? And, and they asked me all the time. And so I think about these things. And it is ice cream. And Ben and Jerry's are being some of the finest purveyors of it. And I love caramel. I love toffee. I love that kind of taste. And it's heaven. So we'd all have a whole punnet each.
James Acaster 1:03:49 Yes. The consistency of it. How hard do you like the ice cream? how soft do you like it?
Rafe Spall 1:03:54 I don't want to bend a spoon putting it in? Yeah, so it needs What? 10 minutes out of fridge?
Ed Gamble 1:03:58 Yeah, I agree with that.
Rafe Spall 1:03:59 What do you reckon
Ed Gamble 1:04:00 I'd say 10 to 15. I don't mind it a little bit soft. But I don't want it, I don't want it rock hard. I don't want that thing where you go in for a big scoop and you only get a little slither off the top and it goes pinging across the room. I hate that.
Rafe Spall 1:04:09 Yeah, I know. It's the worst, the worst, but you want it, you want it. You're so desperate for it. And you know, so I have an aga, so I somewhat expedite it by laying it next to the aga.
Ed Gamble 1:04:19 Yeah, that's a good tip.
Rafe Spall 1:04:21 Get yourself an aga and a wine cellar. I'm painting a picture of myself, painting a picture of myself here. So just a simple caramel choo choo, and then an espresso. I'll have a nice espresso. Just to get me on my way. Just to cut through all that food. Just to shake it all. A digestif as it were.
Ed Gamble 1:04:40 Just to get you on the way to the afterlife.

Yeah, exactly. Exactly. I'll have that and then and then I'll probably get back on the lagers again.
Ed Gamble 1:04:46 Can you do that? Can you get back on lagers after a big meal because I'd then have to stick to wine or I'd have to go with spirits.
Rafe Spall 1:04:52 If I'm out drinking, like at a dinner or whatever. Always go back to lager because it's you know, a sobering beer, a nice sobering beer. You have a lager, it just you know where you are with it. It's not it's not too, it's not going to, nothing unexpected, just a little beer you're going to be fine. And you can stick on the beers.
Ed Gamble 1:05:08 When you said sobering beer though. I think there were definitely some driving lessons that you missed.
James Acaster 1:05:14 This is the lowest I've ever given anyone, mainly because you're hammered, but somehow you were able to get round all the corners. I'm gonna read you your menu back now Rafe, and we'll see how you feel about it. It's like reading a fucking novel. Here we go. Water, bubbly fresh with Robinsons in squash. Poppadoms or bread, sourdough with salted butter and salt. Starter, two vodka martinis with a quarter pint of beer while you wait for the martinis. Then you want to look at the menu and then you'll choose Tricolore salad, tuna nigiri, grilled haloumi, hummus with pita, watermelon duck and cashew salad from The Ivy, and creamed polenta with mushrooms. Main course. For the table you want spotted pig cheeseburger medium rare with string fries, porterhouse steak cooked Chicago style with English mustard. Melanzane parmigiana, chicken burrito with guacamole. Side dish, french fries, dauphinoise potatoes, pickled cucumber salad, tomato and red onion salad, truffle macaroni from The Waverley zucchini fritti, ketchup, vinegar and tartar sauce. Drink. Diet Coke with a 1990 claret on the side, although, I'm pretty sure there were more drinks there but we kept on to the dessert, which is, Ben and Jerry's Carmel choo choo, left out of the fridge for about 10 to 15 minutes. How's that feel?
Rafe Spall 1:06:26 Sounds good, don't it?
James Acaster 1:06:26 That sounds good man.
Rafe Spall 1:06:27 You'd enjoy that wouldn't you. Even if it'd be a bit overwhelming. It'd be fun. You'd have a nice evening out.
Ed Gamble 1:06:32 I think it's safe to say that that's my favourite menu of all time.

Rafe Spall 1:06:35 There you go. Fabulous. Fabulous. It's, well I'm pleased. Yeah, I love food. Going out to eat at restaurants is my is my favourite thing to do in the world.
James Acaster 1:06:46 And now this is your dream restaurant. Yeah. And you get to die at the end eating yourself to death
Rafe Spall 1:06:50 Eating myself to death.
James Acaster 1:06:51 And then we all stand around and we just watch you just slip off into the afterlife. With a moment's silence and then Ed'd slowly walk out and get into his car and just drive to your house and knock on the door and go, Hello, I'm here to choose the wine.
Ed Gamble 1:07:07 Do I have to deliver the news of Rafe's death as well?
Rafe Spall 1:07:11 To my wife. Good news and bad news.
Ed Gamble 1:07:15 We all go to the funeral and the person running the service steps up it goes, Okay, ladies, we got a funeral today.
Rafe Spall 1:07:25 Exactly. No hats. No trainers, no attitude.
Ed Gamble 1:07:28 Thank you very much Rafe.
Rafe Spall 1:07:30 Thank you, such it's such a pleasure. Thank you for having me.
Ed Gamble 1:07:38 Well, there we go.
James Acaster 1:07:39 Choo Choo, all aboard. Choo, choo. You are such a happy little boy. You know, I'm really glad that went your way, dessert wise. Because I love Ben and Jerry's. I love caramel choo choo as much as the next guy, unless the next guy is James Acaster and Rafe Spall.
James Acaster 1:07:53 Yeah, favourite food. He said his favourite food is ice ceram.

Off Menu ­ Ep 102: Rafe Spall
Ed Gamble 1:07:57 Fair enough.
James Acaster 1:07:57 You know, I'm gutted that I went off on so many tangents and that we didn't have enough time at the end to talk about ice cream as much as I would like. But we always do redemption episodes, every now and again, we have redemption dinner parties. I say next time Rafe Spall comes in and we talk to him more about ice cream because that's his redemption. He didn't get to talk about icecream enough.
Ed Gamble 1:08:14 His redemption is he didn't get to talk about ice cream enough. Okay, yeah, that makes sense. I'd love to have Rafe back in the dream restaurant. Because as you noticed, we're brothers in arms.
James Acaster 1:08:23 Your brothers in arms, and he didn't choose dandelion and burdock.
Ed Gamble 1:08:26 Thank the Lord, thank the Lord. Thank you very much for coming into the dream restaurant Rafe. As your reward, we will now tell everyone that Trying, the second season is available on Apple TV plus from May the 14th. If you haven't seen the first season, go watch that in preparation for season two.
James Acaster 1:08:44 Fantastic.
Ed Gamble 1:08:46 Thanks very much. We will see you again sometime soon. In the dream restaurant. Goodbye.
